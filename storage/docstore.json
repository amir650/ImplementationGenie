To be able to do that, you\nneed to assign the Pagero document sending profile to the customer (see pictures below), this is to\nindicate that each invoice created for customers having the Pagero sending profile should be sent\nthrough Pagero.\n\n10 | Pagero Group | www.pagero.com\nE-Invoices\nYou can either send invoices against Pagero\u2019s general customer directory or maintain your own\ncustomer directory in Pagero Online. The latter is the default option. If you maintain your own\ncustomer directory, Pagero\u2019s interface will guide you through the necessary steps needed to\nestablish a connection if such requirements exist. If you don\u2019t wish to maintain a customer directory,\nyou can change it by navigating to Settings -> Company settings -> Outbound -> Routing and\nselecting \u201cOn\u201d.\nE-mail\nAdd an e-mail on the customer card by navigating to Action->E-Mail Distribution. You can add one\nmain e-mail and several Cc e-emails by separating them with one of the following symbols: [,], [;], [|].\nYou can also add e-mails for a specific contact by navigating to Contact card->Actions-> E-Mail\nDistribution.\n11 | Pagero Group | www.pagero.com\nPrint\nIf the customer is not identified as an e-invoice receiver or e-mail receiver, the invoice will be sent as\na printed invoice. If the invoice is being printed no additional actions are needed in Pagero Online.\nBefore sending documents\nCheck the International standard codes\nThe international standard codes for the unit of measures you are using needs to be added in the\nERP. The international standard codes could be found in:\nhttps://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/recommendations/rec20/rec20_rev3_Annex2e.pdf. Below\nimage is an example of the International standard codes added.\n12 | Pagero Group | www.pagero.com\nAdd tax registration status if needed\nIn some countries, a tax registration status needs to be stated on the invoices. In Sweden for\nexample, the text \u201cGodk\u00e4nd f\u00f6r F-Skatt\u201d or similar might be needed to state in the invoices. To add\nthe needed text, place it in Company information as shown in the image below.\nSending documents\nOnce the Pagero Document Sending profile is assigned to a customer, all sales and service\ndocuments will be sent to Pagero Online for that customer.

hosted service that enables a company to form relationships with their suppliers and conduct \norder and invoicing transactions over the Internet. Buying organizations use Ariba Network to find suppliers from \nwhich they want to purchase products or services and invite suppliers to form trading relationships. After a supplier \nhas been enabled on the Ariba Network, the buying organization can view any public catalogs the supplier has \ncreated or receive customer-specific catalogs from their suppliers. Buyers can then place orders, and suppliers in \nturn can create order-based invoices.\nIf the buyer allows, suppliers can also create invoices that are not based on a purchase order or enable a supplier to \npunch into the buyer\u2019s invoicing system to create contract-based invoices.\nBuyer customers use one of the following invoicing solutions to connect to the Ariba Network:\n\u25cf An SAP Ariba cloud solution: SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management\n\u25cf An SAP Ariba on premise solution: Ariba Buyer with the Ariba Invoice module\n\u25cf Ariba Invoice Automation, which connects an external ERP to the Ariba Network to exchange cXML documents \nvia one of the supported Ariba Network adapters.\nThrough Ariba Network, buyers and suppliers can seamlessly integrate their invoicing processes on a single \nnetwork.\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 7\nFigure 1: e-Invoice: architecture and services\nSuppliers can either create invoices online in their Ariba Network account or submit them electronically from their \nexternal system via cXML or EDI.

Invoices that fail that validation are rejected. Only after they are accepted by Ariba Network are they then \ndigitally signed (if required based on the From and To country on the invoice).\nOnce the invoices are validated and signed, they are downloaded to the buyer\u2019s invoicing system for review and \napproval. If the buyer finds a discrepancy (e.g. between the expected and actual tax amount or a line item invoice to \npurchase order mismatch) they can then dispute or reject the invoice and require the supplier to resubmit a \ncorrected invoice.\nRelated Information\nAriba Network user permissions [page 12]\nSAP Ariba security practices\nThe SAP Ariba solution components support general commercial good security practices that ensure \nconfidentiality, security and integrity of the business system. SAP Ariba\u2019s current audit report is the WebTrust \n(http://www.webtrust.org ) seal. SAP Ariba is audited against this standard every six months by an external \nindependent auditor for its cloud solutions including the Ariba Network.\n8 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing\nThe certification provides reasonable assurance that, based on the AICPA/CA Trust Services Criteria for Security \nConfidentiality, Availability and Processing Integrity Criteria:\n\u25cf the systems are protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical);\n\u25cf the systems are available for operation and use as committed or agreed;\n\u25cf the system processing is complete, accurate, timely and authorized;\n\u25cf information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed; and\n\u25cf SAP Ariba has complied with its commitments regarding security, availability, processing integrity, and \nconfidentiality.\nSAP Ariba ensures the integrity of invoice data transmitted between Ariba Network and the SAP Ariba invoicing \nsolutions through Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nInvoicing prerequisites\nThe enablement for invoicing in Ariba Network is a buyer-driven process that follows these steps:\n1. If the supplier does not have an account on the Ariba Network, they either create an account in Ariba Network \nor take ownership of an account that the buyer has pre-enabled for them. No matter how a supplier starts \nusing the Ariba Network resources, they first must register and accept the Terms of Use. Acceptance of the \nTerms of Use is required for all users of a supplier account, regardless if they are the account administrator or a \nuser of the supplier company granted access to the account.\nThe Terms of Use for suppliers is available for review on http://supplier.ariba.com on the bottom of the page.\n2. The supplier and buyer establish the trading relationship.\n\ue05c Note\nSteps 1 and 2 are recorded with a date (\u201cNetwork TC Acceptance Date\u201d and \u201cRelationship Status-Last \nUpdate\u201d) and can be downloaded as part of the buyer side \u201cSupplier Account History\u201d report.\n3. The buyer configures their Ariba Network account to accept invoices from the supplier and specifies specific\ninvoice rules that the supplier-submitted invoices must adhere to. By default, these rules govern invoices from \nall suppliers, however buyers can override these rules for specific groups of suppliers or by country.\n4. The supplier reviews the buyer-specific invoice rules under \u201cCustomer Relationships\u201d details in the supplier \naccount.\nInvoice rules\nBuyers must specifically allow authorized suppliers to create invoices using the Ariba Network user interface or to \ntransmit them from their own back end system through the Ariba Network. If a buyer has disabled the invoicing \nfeature for some suppliers, then those suppliers will not have access to the invoicing functionality when reviewing \nthe buyer\u2019s purchase orders and they will not be able to enter non-PO", "start_char_idx": 18332, "end_char_idx": 22334, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7d8219d-0f7a-4e8b-b870-dbcea33a8708": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7d8219d-0f7a-4e8b-b870-dbcea33a8708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "61329ab2-b48f-43f0-ba87-f06c68faba38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ec933cd0981139256b0a951e1e31ed1d4d5b05f540ed804a094527b9ce9e965"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ba40111-f813-401c-a207-42f6eed5cec9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9f34bf563db25a5b99c6c57def6267385ad2f07778af365d21f7c3df95b2ba4"}}, "hash": "30e760c8c68a89117f08adf3b8d360fdcfb216b9e04e14cc59bdc78f55fd7b02", "text": "buyer\u2019s purchase orders and they will not be able to enter non-PO invoices for those buyers. If attempts are \nmade by a supplier to send automated invoices using cXML or EDI, those invoices will be automatically rejected.\nAfter a supplier is authorized to send invoices electronically to a buyer, those invoices will be validated against the \nbuyer\u2019s configured invoice rules. The rules established on the Ariba Network require that suppliers and buyers \nexchange invoices and invoice status updates that contain the specific content for a wide range of requirements, \nincluding VAT compliance. When a supplier user creates invoices in the Ariba Network user interface, the fields and \nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 9\nvalidations available to them on the user interface are controlled by the invoice rules that the buyer has configured.\nIf they send invoices through cXML or EDI, the same invoice rules apply and invoices that don\u2019t fulfill the specific\ncriteria set forth by the invoice rules will be rejected.\nTesting the invoice process\nTest accounts are free Ariba Network accounts that allow buyers and suppliers to test purchase order and invoice \nexchange (routing, creation, and processing). These test accounts enable transaction partners to send and receive \ntest purchase orders and invoices without the risk of actually shipping products or disrupting production \ntransactions.\nTest accounts provide a safe way for new and existing buyers and suppliers to exercise Ariba Network. New buyers \ntypically spend several days testing their procurement systems and Ariba Network configurations. Similarly, new \nsuppliers spend several days testing their order receiving system and Ariba Network configurations. Buyers and \nsuppliers also use test accounts when testing their new trading relationships.\nBoth buyers and suppliers use test accounts, not production accounts, for this testing. When they are confident\nthat the purchase order and invoice processes are working, they switch from their test accounts to their production \naccounts.\nTo perform testing, buyers and suppliers must coordinate with each other. Both buyer and supplier must use either \ntest accounts or production accounts; the two types will not communicate with each other.\nFor more information on test accounts, see the topic \"Using Test Accounts in Ariba Network\" in the Product \nDocumentation > For Administrators section of the Learning Center.\nAriba Network invoicing\u2014buyer\u2019s perspective\nAfter a trading relationship has been established with a supplier in Ariba Network, buyers can download catalogs \nfrom their suppliers and then use their procurement application to generate purchase orders. Procurement \napplications send purchase orders to Ariba Network, which either stores them for suppliers to pick up or routes \nthem to suppliers through one of several protocols. Suppliers can respond with order confirmations, ship notices, \nand invoices.\nIt is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to allow invoicing by setting invoice rules. By enabling the appropriate invoice rules, \nbuyers can allow suppliers to:\n\u25cf Create standard invoices against purchase orders.\n\u25cf Create non-PO invoices and credit memos.\n\u25cf Create invoices against contracts by accessing the customers\u2019 contract collaboration sites.\nAriba Network automatically routes purchase orders to suppliers through cXML, email, fax, or EDI. Working with an \nSAP Ariba representative, buyers can also customize the Ariba Network supplier user interface to allow suppliers to \nupload invoices in CSV (comma-separated value) format. Suppliers specify their preferred order routing method, \nand Ariba Network takes care of the format, protocol, and delivery details.\n10 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing\nRelated Information\nInvoice rules [page 54]\nViewing invoices\nWhile buyers can view their suppliers\u2019 invoices in their", "start_char_idx": 22353, "end_char_idx": 26324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ba40111-f813-401c-a207-42f6eed5cec9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ba40111-f813-401c-a207-42f6eed5cec9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7d8219d-0f7a-4e8b-b870-dbcea33a8708", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "30e760c8c68a89117f08adf3b8d360fdcfb216b9e04e14cc59bdc78f55fd7b02"}, "3": {"node_id": "72e0f0fc-dedf-4ed9-8c75-f1c02affa6fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3204cf05acaf352b941819ee913caf5b7092a3f066c77ea4a90fc4ea21e7c87"}}, "hash": "f9f34bf563db25a5b99c6c57def6267385ad2f07778af365d21f7c3df95b2ba4", "text": "invoices\nWhile buyers can view their suppliers\u2019 invoices in their Ariba Network online Inbox, most buyer users review and \napprove the invoices in their own invoicing solution. Generally, an account administrator might need to review \ninvoices that for some reason cannot be downloaded to the buyer\u2019s invoicing solution and then resend stuck \ninvoices after resolving the issue.\nThe Invoices section of the Inbox shows details about each invoice, including columns showing the invoice routing \nmethod, origin, and source document (or order type). The transactions list can be configured to show failed \ninvoices, show or hide columns, group transactions by column, export tables to spreadsheet applications such as \nMicrosoft Excel, and control the number of transactions displayed (the default is 100).\nBuyer users can also use the cXML Viewer at https://service-2.ariba.com/Buyer.aw/ad/displayInvoice to upload \na file containing the cXML invoice to generate a human-readable representation of the actual invoice data.\nEditing invoices sent from an Invoice Conversion Service\nSAP Ariba invoice conversion services (ICS) solutions facilitate conversion of paper invoices to an electronic format \nusing a process that includes validation. An invoice conversion service provider receives paper invoices on behalf of \nthe buying organization and converts them to an electronic format for posting to Ariba Network. Invoices sent from \nsuch service providers are labeled ICS Paper Invoices in the Ariba Network inbox.\nBuyers who subscribe to an ICS solution can edit and resubmit unassigned invoices on Ariba Network. An \nunassigned invoice is an ICS invoice with an unknown supplier, which means Ariba Network either did not find a \npurchase order matching the invoice or cannot verify the supplier ID.\nBuyers can also edit and resubmit ICS invoices rejected by their Ariba Network invoice rules or by their invoicing \napplication.\nAriba Network invoicing\u2014supplier\u2019s perspective\nSuppliers in Ariba Network have two options for generating electronic invoices:\n\u25cf manually, using the Generate Invoice feature provided in Ariba Network\n\u25cf programmatically, using cXML or EDI\nTo generate invoices manually, suppliers do not need to do any special setup once buyers are prepared to receive \ninvoices. Suppliers can generate invoices and credit memos online in their Ariba Network account, or use their own \nsystems to generate cXML or EDI invoices and route them through Ariba Network. To generate invoices \nprogrammatically, suppliers must work with buyers to understand their special requirements for invoice \nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 11\nconfiguration.

Invoice validation depends on how a supplier generates invoices:\n\u25cf Online\u2014Ariba Network validates online invoices during data entry and displays onscreen messages for any \nerrors that must be corrected. Ariba Network enforces validation of customer invoice rules by customizing the \nonline display of editable and read-only content.\n\u25cf cXML\u2014Ariba Network validates cXML invoices against the cXML DTD to ensure proper format and syntax. If \nthe invoice passes syntax validation, the supplier receives a cXML response with a 201 status. If the invoice fails \nvalidation, the supplier receives a 500 status and details of the errors. Then, Ariba Network validates them \nagainst the buyer\u2019s invoice rules.\n\u25cf CSV\u2014Ariba Network converts CSV invoices to cXML. Ariba Network will provide suppliers with the necessary \ntemplates for formatting CSV invoices. Ariba Network checks the CSV invoices against the buyer\u2019s invoice \nformat during the import process. If the invoice does not have the proper format, Ariba Network issues a \ndetailed error message. After successful import, Ariba Network converts the invoices to cXML and validates \nthem against the buyer\u2019s invoice rules.\n\u25cf EDI\u2014Ariba Network validates EDI invoices against the ANSI X12 or EDIFACT standard. If the invoice passes \nvalidation, Ariba Network issues a positive Functional Acknowledgement. If the invoice fails validation, Ariba \nNetwork issues a negative Functional Acknowledgment with details of the errors. It then converts invoices to \ncXML and validates them against the buyer\u2019s invoice rules.\nBuyers can use purchase order control keys to override invoice rules. For instance, buyers can use control keys to \nallow their suppliers to create invoices directly from service orders without a service sheet.\nSuppliers can review the rules that have been specified by the buyer for invoice transactions in the Customer \nDetails page of their Ariba Network account (Customer Relationships > Customer Details).\nAdditional resources about Ariba Network invoicing\nFor more information about Ariba Network and the invoicing features available to suppliers and buyers, refer to the \nfollowing product documentation:\nAvailable for buyer users:\n\u25cf Ariba Network buyer administration guide\n\u25cf Ariba Network guide to invoice conversion\n\u25cf Ariba Network cXML solutions guide\nAvailable for supplier", "start_char_idx": 34159, "end_char_idx": 38017, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a84b2da9-1cc5-4c31-8afb-92eb97e22c86": {"__data__": {"id_": "a84b2da9-1cc5-4c31-8afb-92eb97e22c86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c796227-dbdc-4a55-b1fb-d8283fb8dd2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0328130ccab52f8220dde9e1054fbb97e379186e1ecca07146e11ad4d0b6dc6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6955201-a8a3-431e-a0f4-5a3ddb6c56b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0449d5e83f5dbdb97f98e64b9e5d1f47a404dc62351cc30f3ff3058c3db4ed72"}}, "hash": "cbb270157c3a64a7ecc14d7e04c4800044dc8fdaeaa6733fe8dc215e4cdd6f8c", "text": "conversion\n\u25cf Ariba Network cXML solutions guide\nAvailable for supplier users:\n\u25cf Account settings and pUo\u02a5OH Fon\u02a5JuUDtLon topics\n\u25cf &on\u02a5JuULnJ document routing topics\n\u25cf Ariba Network cXML solutions guide\n\u25cf Creating and managing invoices, credit memos, and debit memos topics\n16 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nIntroducing Ariba Network invoicing\nInvoice creation\nCreating invoices [page 17]\nInvoice compliance for contract-based invoices [page 19]\nSelf-billing invoices [page 21]\nInvoice creation process [page 24]\nPDF copy of invoices [page 32]\nInvoice archival options and delivery [page 35]\nLong term archiving of tax invoices [page 38]\nSupport for PDF invoices [page 40]\nCreating invoices\nAriba Network supports the creation, validation, and routing of electronic invoices and credit memos.

A single invoice can be created for all the \nLean Service line items in a purchase order.\nNon-PO These invoices reference purchase orders that were not routed through Ariba Network. \nNon-PO invoices also allow suppliers to invoice purchase orders that have expired and \nbeen deleted, or to generate an invoice that does not have a corresponding purchase order. \nNon-PO invoices can be issued to a buying organization even if the supplier doesn\u2019t already \nhave an active trading relationship with the buying organization. In that case, the buyer \nprovides the supplier with buyer customer code to allow sending a non-PO invoice (quick \nenablement through invoice).\nCredit memo A credit memo represents an amount owed to a buyer by a supplier, typically from an ear\u0002lier transaction such as a purchase order or a contract invoice. The amount due is a nega\u0002tive number.\nThere are four types of credit memos: PO-based header level credit memos, PO-based \nline-level credit memos, non-PO credit memos, and dynamic discounting credit memos.\nLine-level credit memos can be based on a change in quantity or a price adjustment (price \ndecrease).\nLine-level debit memo Line-level debit memos represent an amount owed to a supplier by a buyer from an earlier \ntransaction. Line-level debit memos are always due to a price adjustment (price increase).\nBlanket purchase order based A blanket purchase order (BPO) is a type of contract that buyers create that forms an \nagreement to spend a specific amount with a supplier for critical items or services.

If the customer has multiple procurement applications, they \nselect the business unit address whose contracts they want to access by the Bill To address ID and the contact \nperson.\n2. Ariba Network automatically transfers the supplier user to the buyer\u2019s SAP Ariba invoicing site, where the \nsupplier user selects the contract and enters the invoice number, invoice date, and the Sold To Email (email of \nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 19\nperson who requested the goods or services).

In such cases, receipt of the \ninvoice by the buyer is not required to consider the invoice issued. In other countries, the invoice is considered \nissued only when it has become available to the buyer.\nIn Ariba Network, if digital signatures are applied to meet country-specific requirement, the point of invoice issue is \nthe date and time of the invoice after the invoice has passed the business rules and after it has been digitally \nsigned. The issue date, which is a timestamp on the document after it has been signed, is the date that matters in \nthe parties\u2019 relationship with tax authorities. Upon issue, the invoice may no longer be disposed of or altered and \nboth supplier and buyer are responsible for guaranteeing its integrity and authenticity until the end of the storage \nperiod.\nThe invoice date is the date that matters in the relationship between the buyer and the supplier. For example, \npayment terms calculations are generally based on the invoice date.\nAs a best practice, SAP Ariba recommends that suppliers set the current date as the invoice date. Buyers can \nmitigate the risk of a different issue and invoice date by setting the rule Allow invoices to be back-dated the \nspecLfied number of days to zero, which means that Ariba Network will reject any invoice with an invoice date \nearlier than the current date. However, this might not be practical depending on the supplier\u2019s backend system \nintegration, where any significant delay in transmitting invoices might then mean that entire invoice batches are \nrejected by Ariba Network.\nOverdue documents\nFor documents in the \u201cPending Queue\u201d that Ariba Network has not been able to post or that were not downloaded \nto the buyer\u2019s invoicing system for more than three days,", "start_char_idx": 56730, "end_char_idx": 60601, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e7f539f-a9c9-4c28-ac36-6bb84e85a6a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e7f539f-a9c9-4c28-ac36-6bb84e85a6a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c467ba92-e22b-47dc-8e6d-23beffa016c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef04ef10cf3eef6539f93c726c5caf34f0403061d0cee870b357a319fce49143"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddbd0eea-99a4-45e9-8851-59c36a88dad4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41502aff7cd6084bb6a2b243593c058f71c6d04aa1b955344078823a5706e621"}}, "hash": "feb9fca68150cde1c5b1abfb04f00603785106062f36dc6431a6ea36f9c3b528", "text": "downloaded \nto the buyer\u2019s invoicing system for more than three days, Ariba Network sends an email notification that lists the \nunacknowledged documents in an email attachment to the buyer.

Deleting a document from the \npending queue does not delete it from Ariba Network, the document remains accessible in the Inbox.\nInvoice addresses and validation\nFor invoice compliance, Ariba Network allows buying organizations to use invoicing rules to specify whether values \nmust be provided for the following addresses: Sold To, Bill To, From, Ship To, Ship From, and Remit To.\n26 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation\nAriba Network invoices support up to six standard addresses:\n\u25cf Issued By (the From address)\n\u25cf Customer (the Sold To address)\n\u25cf Bill To\n\u25cf Ship From\n\u25cf Ship To\n\u25cf Remit To\nThe Sold To and the Bill To addresses are usually the same, although Sold To is more important for VAT purposes. \nBuyers can require that Ariba Network validate whether Sold To information on invoices matches Bill To information \non purchase orders (or Sold To information, if available). This rule applies only to invoices against a single purchase \norder.\nBuyers can also use invoicing rules to configure multiple Sold To addresses with address details, optional \nassociated VAT ID and/or Sold To Address ID. Buyers can then establish business rules that validate the Sold To on \na supplier\u2019s invoice against the list of Sold To addresses & VAT IDs. Buyers can specify that only Name, ISO Country, \nand VAT ID are used to validate the Sold To address or that the complete address is used for validation.\nForeign currencies\nAriba Network checks to see if invoice data uses a currency that differs from the currency of the Ship To address. In \nthat case, a second currency for tax amounts and for the exchange rate can be stored in the cXML invoice. Only one \nexchange rate is stored per invoice and therefore the same Ship To country must be used on each single invoice.\nIf Ship To details are provided at line item level, then as a best practice buyers and suppliers are advised to ensure \nthat the country of the Ship To addresses and the Sold To address match on the purchase order or invoice.\nThe cXML invoice supports a currency conversion rate field. For online invoice entry it defaults to the exchange rate \nfrom a daily Bloomberg feed (the rates are gathered by Bloomberg from multiple pricing sources). The exchange \nrate is used to calculate the tax amounts in the local Ship To currency and is stored as a second value in the cXML \ninvoice. As some tax authorities require that the exchange rate is to be retrieved from locally published rates, users \ncan update the defaulted exchange rate.\nIncoming invoice data (cXML, EDI or CSV) is validated if the tax information is specified in the currency of the Ship \nTo information. If the tax information is specified at the invoice header level, and there are multiple Ship To \ncountries at line item level, Ariba Network does not validate local tax currencies.\n1otLficatLon framework\nAriba Network can send automatic notifications by email when certain events affect the supplier and buyer \naccount.

In this \nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 29\ncase, the fiscal representative\u2019s name and address must be included on the invoice. If the fiscal representative pays \nVAT in another EU member state, then their VAT identification number must also be included on the invoice. Ariba \nNetwork provides standard invoice fields to capture this information.\nNon-domestic trade\nFor non-domestic trade scenarios, all fields required on invoices for trade between two EU countries (intra-EU \ntrade) or for trade where at least one non-EU country is involved (cross-border trade) are available and covered by \nstandard invoice fields.\nIn both intra-EU and cross-border trade, buyers may be required to comply with a range of country-specific\nrequirements. SAP Ariba recommends seeking the advice of a local tax expert when engaging in either of these \npractices.\nThe requirements for each of these scenarios are generally as follows:\nIntra-EU Trade: When products or services are sold from suppliers in one EU country to a buyer in a different EU \ncountry, the supplier uses a zero-rate VAT on the invoice if the buyer can provide a valid VAT ID. The buyer, in turn, \nmust then declare local VAT associated with their acquisition of products or services to the appropriate tax \nauthority (reverse charge) and can then reclaim this amount, provided all tax requirements for tax reclaim are met. \nIf services are purchased, the supplier is also required to clearly note, on the invoice, that the tax liability is with the \nbuyer.\nWhile digital signatures are required for domestic trade, for intra-EU trade the requirements for digital signing are \nmore ambiguous. Therefore, SAP Ariba takes a conservative approach and signs based on both countries - the \nFrom and To country.\nCross-Border Trade: Invoices can also be exchanged for cross border trade of products or services that occur either \nfrom a supplier in an EU country to a buyer in a non-EU country, or vice versa. From a VAT perspective it is however \nmore important to document the cross-border delivery and receiving of goods or services\u2014the invoice builds only \none part of the documentation. In cases of product trade a customs declaration is required and appropriate taxes \nand customs fees for import/export must be paid.\n30 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation\nVAT ID related rules\nThe table below displays the invoice fields that are impacted by VAT ID related Ariba Network invoices rules.

For each specified invoice archival period, Ariba Network waits for a 30-day period \nbefore it begins the archival process unless you want to archive invoices immediately. The 30 day lag time for \narchiving reflects the average time it takes for an invoice to complete the invoicing cycle.\nFor example: Using the Weekly option, the beginning date for the invoice archival is the date that you start \narchiving. If you start archiving on December 12, then the end date of the weekly invoice archival period is \nDecember 18. After seven days (December 19), Ariba Network waits for a 30 day period to January 18 and then \narchives the invoices that were created between December 12 through 18.\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 35\nArchived invoices are available for download from the Archived Invoices page in the Outbox for suppliers and the \nInbox for buyers. Ariba Network can also send archived invoice files to the pending queue or automatically deliver \nthem (via HTTPS) as soon as they are available.\nAutomatic delivery\nRegardless of whether your organization chooses to utilize the HTTPS option for automatic delivery, archive invoice \nfiles continue to be stored for up to three months in the buyer\u2019s Inbox or supplier\u2019s Outbox.\nThe URL for the archived zip file can be any URL where you want Ariba Network to automatically deliver the \narchived zip files. You can specify a URL with an https prefix so that communication is encrypted. Ariba Network \nuses the HTTPS post method to post the archived zip files to the location specified in the URL. You can \nauthenticate an HTTPS post request based on the client certificate available for Ariba Network. For a list of Ariba \nNetwork\u2019s trusted certificate authorities, see the Ariba Network cXML solutions guide.\nAriba Network provides information about automatic delivery attempts in the Delivery Status and Delivery Date \ncolumns on the Archive Invoices page. If a delivery attempt of an archive fails, then Ariba Network sends an email \nnotification explaining the failure. As an alternative, users can check the status in the Delivery Failure Reason \ncolumn of the Archive Invoices page.\nArchive zip file contents\nThe archived invoice zip files created by Ariba Network contain one or more of the following types of information:\n\u25cf Raw invoice data in cXML format.

This archive period also applies to all electronic signatures, certificates, and \nverification protocols.\nThe general requirement for an archive is to ensure that invoice data cannot be altered or removed. You can achieve \nthis requirement by using special storage media (such as WORM technology = Write Once, Read Many) and \napplying a digital signature, which guarantees integrity (a proof that a document is unchanged) in combination with \nsecure access rights to the storage location.\n\ue05c Note\nThe certificate used for the digital signature might expire during the archiving period. This is not critical as the \ncertificate only needs to be valid at signing, transmission, and receiving time. After the invoice has been \narchived, the certificate can expire because the validity of the certificate at the time of issue remains verifiable\nthrough the stored verification protocol. The integrity can always be confirmed through a cryptographic \nverification of the signature regardless of the validity of the certificate at the time of audit.\nDownload archived invoices from the pending queue\nYou can choose to automatically send archived invoice files to the pending queue, facilitating secure download.\nIf archived invoice files are sent to the pending queue, you can download them over an HTTPS connection from \nyour external ERP system to the Ariba Network using a GetPendingRequest and DataRequest pair.\nOnly one archived invoice file can be downloaded per GetPendingRequest and DataRequest pair. When using a \nGetPendingRequest to query for archived invoice files in the pending queue, you must set the maxMessages \nvalue to 1 to prevent failure in the case of excessive attachment sizes. If you choose to send archived invoices to the \npending queue, you cannot also have archived invoice files automatically delivered via HTTPS.\nExample GetPendingRequest for archived invoice files\n<GetPendingRequest lastReceivedTimestamp=\"2015-02-13T16:00:00-08:00\" \nmaxMessages=\"1\">\n <MessageType>InvoiceArchive</MessageType>\n</GetPendingRequest>\nFor additional information about archived invoices and the pending queue, see the Ariba Network buyer \nadministration guide.\nFor more information about configuring and using a GetPendingRequest and DataRequest pair to pull data \nfrom the pending queue, see the Ariba Network integration guide\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 37\nHow to set invoice archiving options for buyers\nPrerequisites\nThe Allow suppliers to send invoices to this account rule must be checked in your Ariba Network account.\nProcedure\n1.

The supplier generates a PDF invoice from their accounting system.\n2. The supplier uploads the PDF invoice to Ariba Network. Prior to the upload, the supplier is prompted to choose \na buyer.\n3.

During the process the \ndocument is listed on the PDF Conversions page in Ariba Network with the status Conversion Pending. When \nthe conversion is completed successfully, the result can be seen on the PDF Conversions page with the status \nConverted.\nIf errors occur during the conversion process, the supplier sees the status Conversion Failed on the History tab \nof the PDF Document Details page.

The supplier may choose to review conversion results before submission (which is recommended), or to \nautomatically submit the converted PDF invoices to Ariba Network.\n5. If the supplier wants to review the conversion results before submission, Ariba Network generates a draft \ninvoice, which is visible in the Drafts tab of the supplier\u2019s Outbox. The original PDF invoice from the supplier is \nincluded as an attachment in the generated draft invoice. The supplier must review the draft invoice within \nseven days, edit it to correct any errors, and submit the invoice. Otherwise the status of the draft invoice is set \nto Failed. This review is done on the Drafts tab of the supplier\u2019s Outbox.\n6. When the supplier chooses to submit the extraction result without manual validation, the cXML invoice is \ncreated and the supplier can view the invoice status on the Invoices tab of the supplier\u2019s Outbox, or if they \nhave subscribed to receive email notifications, they receive an email notification of the invoice status. After \nsuccessful validation, the invoice status is updated to Sent on the Invoices tab of the supplier\u2019s Outbox.\nIf errors occur during the automatic submission process, then the invoice appears with the status Failed on the \nInvoices tab. The supplier can edit the invoice in order to comply with the validation rules and resubmit it. The \nrecord of the previous failed invoice remains in the system with the status Obsoleted.\n7. From this point, invoice processing converges with the standard Ariba Network process:\n1. The cXML is digitally signed (depending on the originating and destination countries).\n2. The cXML and the original PDF from the supplier are optionally archived based on the buyer and supplier \nconfiguration.\n8.

Some rules can be set to require suppliers to provide certain information, other rules control if a \nsupplier is granted a choice to include certain information or not.\nAriba Network evaluates these rules against online, cXML, or EDI invoices from suppliers. It rejects invoices that fail \nvalidation, so buyers receive only invoices that are compatible with their procurement system configuration.\nBuyers can configure rules in the Invoice Rules section of the Default Transaction Rules page in their Ariba \nNetwork account ( Administration ConfiJuratLon Default Transaction Rules ). However, they can override \nthem for specific suppliers and supplier groups or the country from where the invoice is sent.\nSuppliers can review the rules that have been specified by the buyer for invoice transactions in the Customer \nDetails page of their Ariba Network account (Customer Relationships > Customer Details).\nInvoice rule levels\nAriba Network categorizes invoice rules into the following levels:\n\u25cf Default Transaction Rules\nThese rules are available in the Default Transaction Rules page.\n\u25cf Supplier Group Rule Level\nThese rules are supplier-group specific rules that are enabled in the Supplier Group Transaction Rules page. \nSupplier group rules are a subset of the rules available at the default transaction rule level and they override the \ninvoice rules specified on the Default Transaction Rules page. However, the way in which Ariba Network \napplies the rules is different when the supplier belongs to a supplier group and the buyer has enabled country\u0002based invoice rules for the supplier\u2019s country.\n\u25cf Country-based Invoice Rule Level\nThe country-based invoice rules are a subset of the default transaction rules and supplier group rules. Buyers \ncan define country-based invoice rules for any country.\nSAP Ariba provides a set of invoice rules that have predefined settings in the form of templates for a list of \ncountries. These templates reflect SAP Ariba\u2019s current knowledge of invoice requirements for those countries. \n54 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules\nBuyers can use these templates as a starting point to configure their country-based invoice rules, since the \ncountry-based default settings may not be", "start_char_idx": 115341, "end_char_idx": 119427, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a44a5b9-e13a-4676-abd5-47eaf1315984": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a44a5b9-e13a-4676-abd5-47eaf1315984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a148df3-3672-472a-8407-aa25f561e5da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1880d50321263b623b815cd7b6df72ad1d2b6313f7a7eea0563d625f41b4f177"}, "3": {"node_id": "525f2e28-c128-41dd-90fe-9b5e1a74d1ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39d94a85c2606e7baa4b620c42480afb77026cc216cd1991118e27fd72c68012"}}, "hash": "c32d59965f54ed7ea9937bafc57dec5a50428eb08d811deb2d203683d38c7bf3", "text": "their country-based invoice rules, since the \ncountry-based default settings may not be appropriate for every organization. SAP Ariba strongly recommends \nthat buyers consult their tax and/or legal advisors to determine the applicability of any business rule \nimplementation.\nICS invoice rules\nFor buyers that subscribe to SAP Ariba invoice conversion services (ICS), SAP Ariba provides a separate set of \ninvoice rules for invoices sent from an ICS provider. For information about ICS invoice rules, see the Ariba Network \nguide to invoice conversion.\nInvoice rule types\nRules are categorized into the following rule types:\n\u25cf Allow Rules. When these rules are checked, suppliers have the option to enter values per rule setting or not. If \nthese rules are not checked, the rule behavior is enforced.\nFor example, enabling the PO-based invoice rule Allow suppliers to change the unit price makes the unit price \nan editable field. If the rule is not checked, then suppliers cannot modify the unit price when creating an invoice \nonline, and the unit price of the invoice is validated against the purchase order unit price when submitting a \ncXML or EDI invoice.\n\u25cf Require Rules. When these rules are checked, the buyer mandates that the supplier provides certain \ninformation on the invoice. When these rules are not checked, suppliers have the option to leave that \ninformation blank.\nFor example, enabling the rule Require suppliers to provide a reason for each credit memo requires that \nsuppliers enter a reason when submitting a credit memo. If the rule is not checked, suppliers can still enter a \nreason for a credit memo, but the invoice is not rejected if they don\u2019t.\n\u25cf Other Rules\nThe following are other rules that don\u2019t start with Allow or Require, but that are processed as Require rules:\n\u25cb Enforce strict address validation for required address fields\n\u25cb Display text boxes for buyer and supplier VAT IDs in invoice headers\n\u25cb Display invoice totals as Subtotal, Tax Amount, and Amount Due\n\u25cb Copy Bill To address on purchase orders to Sold To address on invoices\nInvoice rule application\nAriba Network applies rules that are available for configuration at the default transaction rule level, the supplier \ngroup rule level, and the country-based rule level.\nGenerally, supplier group rules override default transaction rules, and the country-based rules are evaluated either \nagainst the default transaction rules or supplier group rules (if defined) to determine how to enforce a rule based \non the rule type (Require or Allow rule).\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 55\nEvaluation of default transaction rules\nA default transaction level rule is applied if any of the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf The rule only exists at the default transaction rule level.\n\u25cf Country-based invoice rules are not enabled or not activated for the invoice country of origin and the supplier \ndoes not belong to a supplier group.\n\u25cf Country-based invoice rules are not enabled or not activated for the invoice country of origin and the supplier \nbelongs to a supplier group that is configured to use the default transaction rules.\n\u25cf Country-based invoice rules are defined and activated for the invoice country of origin but the supplier belongs \nto a supplier group that is configured to use the default transaction rules and the buyer has not enabled \ncountry-based rules (the rule Ignore country-based invoice rules is checked at the default transaction rule \nlevel).\nEvaluation of supplier group rules\nA supplier group level rule is applied if any of the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf Country-based invoice rules are defined or are active for the originating country of the invoice, however the \nbuyer has not enabled country-based rules for the supplier group to which the supplier belongs.\n\u25cf Country-based invoice rules are enabled for the supplier group and the supplier belongs to that supplier group, \nbut there are no rules defined for the originating country of the invoice or the buyer has not activated the rules \nfor that country.\n\u25cf The rule exists at the supplier group level, but not at the country rule level and the supplier belongs to that", "start_char_idx": 119399, "end_char_idx": 123591, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "525f2e28-c128-41dd-90fe-9b5e1a74d1ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "525f2e28-c128-41dd-90fe-9b5e1a74d1ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a44a5b9-e13a-4676-abd5-47eaf1315984", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c32d59965f54ed7ea9937bafc57dec5a50428eb08d811deb2d203683d38c7bf3"}, "3": {"node_id": "3aa4f20b-2a3c-4689-ae92-cac2a13d3afb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9c5a82af685ac254b1a9f584ff34985f977ac0be2637c220b947405ecbfdf51"}}, "hash": "39d94a85c2606e7baa4b620c42480afb77026cc216cd1991118e27fd72c68012", "text": "supplier group level, but not at the country rule level and the supplier belongs to that \nsupplier group.\nEvaluation of country-based invoice rules\nCountry-based invoice rules are always evaluated together with either the default transaction rules (if no supplier \ngroup rules apply) or supplier group rules (if the supplier for which the invoice is evaluated belongs to a supplier \ngroup).\nThere is no hierarchy to invoice rules. A country-based rule does not override a supplier group rule or a default rule. \nBuyers must set the rules as shown in the following tables for the rules to be applied. Generally, if a Require rule is \nchecked at any level, the rule is enforced. For an Allow rule to take effect, it must be allowed on both levels.\nAllow rule evaluation\nAllow rules must be checked at both the supplier group level or default transaction level and the country rule level \nfor a supplier to be allowed to perform a certain action.\n56 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules\nExample:\nInvoice rule\nSupplier group rule or \ndefault transaction rule Country-based rule Rule applied in invoice\nAllow suppliers to send header \ncredit memos and debit memos\nNo Yes No\nYes No No\nYes Yes Yes\nNo No No\nRequire rule evaluation\nA Require rule is enforced if this rule is checked at either the supplier group level or country-based rule level.\nExample:\nInvoice rule\nSupplier group rule or \ndefault transaction rule Country-based rule Rule applied in invoice\nRequire suppliers to provide a \nreason for each credit memo\nNo Yes Yes\nYes No Yes\nYes Yes Yes\nNo No No\nCountry-based invoice rules\nCountry-based invoice rules allow buyers to ensure that invoices meet certain country requirements and at the \nsame time group suppliers based on business-related criteria. For example, a buyer that allows some suppliers to \nsend non-PO invoices can now still group them into a supplier group, and in addition define country-specific invoice \nrules that enforce certain rules based on the originating country identified for the invoice.\nBuyers are responsible for editing and then activating country-based invoice rules. The country-based invoice rules \napply to invoices created once the rules have been activated for that country. SAP Ariba recommends that buyers \ndiscuss these rules with their suppliers to avoid unnecessary invoice rejections due to invoice rule enforcement.\nSome country-based invoice rules can be configured by suppliers. For more information, see Country-based invoice \nrules configurable by suppliers [page 61].\nSAP Ariba maintains default country-based invoice rules for the countries based on research with our tax advisors \nand field experience. Although recommended, the default settings for the country-based invoice rules may not be \nappropriate for your organization.

If \nthis is not available, Ariba Network uses the supplier\u2019s address on the invoice.\nTo determine the originating country, Ariba Network checks the invoice for the following information in the order \ngiven below:.\nOrder Originating Country Determined by\u2026\n1 Tax", "start_char_idx": 123595, "end_char_idx": 127607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aa4f20b-2a3c-4689-ae92-cac2a13d3afb": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aa4f20b-2a3c-4689-ae92-cac2a13d3afb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "525f2e28-c128-41dd-90fe-9b5e1a74d1ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39d94a85c2606e7baa4b620c42480afb77026cc216cd1991118e27fd72c68012"}, "3": {"node_id": "57ecb068-3f5f-4be7-917e-3eb97c60be5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb778ceb4e62976239f56707b06fd362aea3d0380806a4861aa03d3ac32b474b"}}, "hash": "a9c5a82af685ac254b1a9f584ff34985f977ac0be2637c220b947405ecbfdf51", "text": "in the order \ngiven below:.\nOrder Originating Country Determined by\u2026\n1 Tax representative\u2019s VAT ID prefix\n2 Tax representative\u2019s country code\n3 Supplier\u2019s VAT ID prefix\n4 \u2018From\u2019 address\u2019s country code\nDocument label based on originating country\nAriba Network will determine the label on invoices and credit memos based on the originating country of the \ninvoice/credit memo.

If blanket purchase order (BPO) invoice rules are configured either at the supplier group/default \ntransaction rule level but not at the country-based rule level or at the country-based rule level and not at the \nsupplier group/default transaction rule level, Ariba Network applies the blanket purchase order invoice rules as \nfollows:\n\u25cf If BPO-specific invoice rules are enabled at the country-based rule level only (that is, Enable BPO-specLfic\ninvoice rules is set to No at the default transaction or supplier group level), and if the supplier belongs to the \nsupplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule process using the values available in the PO \nand Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at the supplier group level to BPO invoices originating from that \ncountry.\nIf the supplier does not belong to the supplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule \nprocess to BPO invoices originating from that country using the PO and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at \nthe default transaction values level.\n\u25cf If BPO-specific invoice rules are enabled at the default transaction or supplier group level only (Enable BPO\u0002specLfic invoice rules is set to No at the country-based rule level), and if the supplier belongs to the supplier \ngroup, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule process using the values in the PO and Non-PO \nInvoice Field Rules section at the country-based rule level to BPO invoices originating from that country.\nIf the supplier does not belong to the supplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule \nprocess to BPO invoices originating from that country using the PO and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at \nthe country-based rule values.\nCountry-based invoice rule to restrict partial credit\nAriba Network buyers in the United States and Australia can enable a country-based invoice rule to restrict partial \ncredit for invoices.\nThe following rule appears in the General Invoice Rules section:\n\u25cf Require suppliers to credit the full invoice amount on line-item credit memos\u2014This rule is available only \nwhen the Allow suppliers to send line-item credit memo rule is checked. When this rule is checked, it requires \nsuppliers to credit the full invoice amount when they send a line-item credit memo. Suppliers can use a credit \nmemo to reverse an invoice\u2019s charges, but they can\u2019t credit only part of the invoice line item. This rule applies to \nline-item credit memos created against material invoices and service invoices.\n\ue05c Note\nWhen this rule is checked:\n\u25cb Price Adjustment rules for credit memos and debit memos are both automatically unchecked.\nThe following invoice rules also affect line-item credit memos:\n\u25cb Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments\u2014If this rule is checked, then suppliers can add the \nAttachment section to the header of a line-item credit memo, and they can attach files.\n\u25cb Require invoice Sold To Name and Country to match PO Bill To Name and Country (or Sold To \ninformation if available)\u2014If this rule is checked, a line-item credit memo displays a warning if the Sold \nTo information doesn\u2019t match the Bill To information from the", "start_char_idx": 127616, "end_char_idx": 131585, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57ecb068-3f5f-4be7-917e-3eb97c60be5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "57ecb068-3f5f-4be7-917e-3eb97c60be5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aa4f20b-2a3c-4689-ae92-cac2a13d3afb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9c5a82af685ac254b1a9f584ff34985f977ac0be2637c220b947405ecbfdf51"}, "3": {"node_id": "a48ba7cf-02c1-4b9b-9458-f86c0a396f9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5a18db09f397335f7ded102cc71a71559e5186ad4dd5d387eb7ef6e891930fc"}}, "hash": "bb778ceb4e62976239f56707b06fd362aea3d0380806a4861aa03d3ac32b474b", "text": "a warning if the Sold \nTo information doesn\u2019t match the Bill To information from the order.\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 59\n\u25cb Require your company's VAT ID for domestic trade\u2014If this rule is checked, the Customer VAT field is \nrequired.\nThe following invoice rules are ignored for line-item credit memos:\n\u25cb Require suppliers to provide tax information in invoice headers or line items\n\u25cb Require VAT\n\u25cb Require your company's VAT ID only for intra-EU trade\nCountry-based invoice rule for automatic invoice creation \nfrom receipts\nAriba Network buyers in the United States, Australia, and South Africa can enable a country-based invoice rule to \nautomatically create invoices from receipts.\nThe following country-based invoice rule allows the Ariba Network buyers in the United States, Australia, and South \nAfrica to invoice automatically when the buyer sends a receipt for received quantities:\n\u25cf Enable automatic invoice creation from receipts\nThis rule is effective only when the default transaction rule Require suppliers to include only received quantities \non invoices is checked. The Enable automatic invoice creation from receipts rule causes the Ariba Network to \nautomatically create an invoice when the buyer sends a receipt for material goods. The rule ensures that invoices \nare based on goods that the buyer has received. This rule makes the invoicing process more efficient, and it \nreduces the possibility of invoices not matching goods receipts. For suppliers, the rule automates invoice creation \nfor material goods and it reduces the possibility of invoices being rejected for not matching goods receipts.\nTo automatically generate invoices based on receipts sent from a buyer, the supplier must agree to automatic \ninvoicing by completing the Automatic Invoice Creation Acceptance page for each buyer that has enabled the \ncountry-based rule.\nSource of data for automatically-generated invoices\nWhen the Ariba Network generates an invoice automatically based on a receipt submitted by the buyer, it gathers \ninformation for the invoice from the purchase order, the receipt, and the supplier's company profile. Header-level \ninformation for the invoice comes from the purchase order. If the tax information is not present on the order, the \nVAT information is obtained from the supplier's company profile.\nItem-level information for the invoice comes from the purchase order with the exception of the following two fields,\nwhich come from the receipt:\n\u25cf Order Line Number\n\u25cf Quantity\n60 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules\nTaxes\nAll taxes for invoices generated automatically from receipts must come from the purchase order. Taxes can be \nspecified at the header-level of the purchase order or at the line-item level, but not in both places. To ensure that \nline item level taxes for standard invoices are copied from the purchase order, the buyer must enable the following \ndefault transaction rule: Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice.\n\ue05c Note\nThe Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice rule does not copy header-level taxes from the \npurchase order, and it does not apply to line item credit memos. For line item credit memos, taxes at line item \nlevel default from the invoice and not from the purchase order.\nAllowances and Charges\nAllowances and charges for invoices generated automatically from receipts must come from the purchase order. \nAllowances and charges can be specified at the header-level of the purchase order and at the line-item level. Like \ntaxes, all allowances and charges should be specified as a percentage rate on the purchase order. The percentage \nis applied to all invoices generated for the order.\n\ue05c Note\nIf an allowance or charge is specified as a flat amount on the purchase order, it is applied to every invoice \ngenerated from a receipt, which could result in cumulatively higher allowances or charges than the customer \nintended.\nFor more information about", "start_char_idx": 131581, "end_char_idx": 135587, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a48ba7cf-02c1-4b9b-9458-f86c0a396f9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a48ba7cf-02c1-4b9b-9458-f86c0a396f9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "57ecb068-3f5f-4be7-917e-3eb97c60be5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb778ceb4e62976239f56707b06fd362aea3d0380806a4861aa03d3ac32b474b"}, "3": {"node_id": "1df3f586-2c3f-4991-a8f1-3a417d8cc680", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2bc867366e5d73cede6208d92fc5ab34c5b06b421ce6f5a3401de6fa3ee11cf"}}, "hash": "a5a18db09f397335f7ded102cc71a71559e5186ad4dd5d387eb7ef6e891930fc", "text": "higher allowances or charges than the customer \nintended.\nFor more information about creating automatic invoices from receipts, see Creating and managing invoices, credit \nmemos, and debit memos.\nCountry-based invoice rules confiJurable by \nsuppliers\nThis optional Ariba Network feature is available to all public suppliers.\nThis feature allows Ariba Network suppliers to configure their own country-based invoice rules for any country.\nSuppliers can configure more than 20 rules for any country or region from where their invoices may originate. The \nrules are a subset of the country-based invoice rules that are available to buyers. If a supplier would choose to \ndefine their own country-based invoice rules, an invoice from the supplier must pass those rules before it is \nvalidated against any invoice rules configured by their buyers.\nSAP Ariba offers invoice rules that have predefined settings in the form of templates for the countries and regions \nin the table below. The default settings for the country-specific invoice rules may not be appropriate for the \nsupplier\u2019s organization. Suppliers must consult their tax and/or legal advisors to determine the applicability of any \nbusiness rule they choose to implement and adjust the settings accordingly.\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nInvoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 61\nSuppliers are responsible for editing and then activating country-based invoice rules.

To use this \nfeature, the ERP system must support downloading of MIME attachments. The invoicing rule Allow \nsuppliers to send invoice attachments does not impact the PDF invoice copy attachment generation, and \ntherefore the option to send URLs to view attachments on Ariba Network is only available for attachments \nadded by the supplier.\n\u25cf Require suppliers to send invoice attachments.\nThis rule requires suppliers to include attachments when they create invoices against purchase orders you \nsubmit to them. The Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments rule must be checked to see and enable \nthis rule.\nWhen the Require suppliers to send invoice attachments rule is checked, the following options are displayed:\n\u25cb For All Invoices\nBy default, this option is selected. Suppliers must add at least one attachment to all types of invoices.\n\u25cb For Material Invoices.\nBuyers can select this option if they require suppliers to send an attachment for invoices containing only \nmaterial line items. Suppliers must add at least one attachment to material invoices.\n\u25cb For Service Invoices\nBuyers can select this option if they require suppliers to send an attachment for invoices containing a \nservice line item.\nThis rule applies to both cXML invoices, and invoices generated from the Ariba Network user interface.

Controls whether suppliers can resend \ninvoices with an invoice number previously used in a past calendar year. This rule is configurable only if Allow \nsuppliers to reuse invoice numbers is checked.\n\ue05c Note\nIf you receive invoices from Italian suppliers, it is recommended that you configure Allow suppliers to \nreuse invoice numbers from past calendar years as a country-based invoice rule for Italy.\nIn Italy, as per legal requirements, invoices must be numbered progressively, allowing univocal \nidentification of each invoice. Numbers assigned to invoices must be consecutive and without gaps, \nsequentially numbered by entry date. In some cases, suppliers choose to use progressive numbering on an \nyearly basis, starting with invoice number 01, and continuing sequentially until the end of the calendar year; \nat the start of the next calendar year, invoice number 01 is used again, and invoice numbers follow \nsequentially thereafter.\n\u25cf Allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at line item level.\nControls whether to allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details (price unit quantity, price unit, unit \nconversion, and pricing description) for a line item in non-service invoices as follows:\n\u25cb On non-PO invoices, if this rule is checked, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details.\n\u25cb On Ariba Network-validated contract invoices, if the contract allows suppliers to modify the unit price or \nadd non-catalog items to the invoice, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details for an invoice line.

This \nrule controls if Ariba Network must map the Bill To Address with the corresponding system ID for the buyer \naccount.\nWhen this rule is checked, Ariba Network maps the Bill To Address with the corresponding system ID of the \nbuyer account for all non-PO invoices sent through cXML or CSV documents.\nCountry-based Invoice Rule Setting: Do not require for any country (default).\n\u25cf Allow case-insensitive invoice matching.\nControls whether Ariba Network disregards the case in invoice numbers when matching invoice status updates \nto invoices. For SAP-enabled ERP systems, invoices received are automatically renumbered using uppercase \ncharacters (for example, inv-123 becomes INV-123). When there is case-insensitive invoice matching, Ariba \nNetwork matches invoice status updates to invoices that are numbered the same except for case. This \nconfiguration setting only affects how Ariba Network matches invoice status updates to invoices, not how \ninvoices are matched to purchase orders.\n\u25cf Allow suppliers to add allowances and charges to invoices.\nThis rule allows suppliers to do the following:\n\u25cb Create PO-based invoices that include all taxes, allowances, and charges cost elements from the purchase \norder on the invoice.\nWhen the supplier creates PO-based invoices, the taxes, allowances, and charges information in the \npurchase order is carried over to the new invoice.

For example, if the buyer enters a customized list of charges but they leave the list of allowances \nempty, Ariba Network displays the default list of allowances to suppliers along with the buyer's customized list \nof charges.\nIf the buyer has added a customized list and has also checked the rule Allow suppliers to include taxes, \nfreight, special handling, discounts, allowances, and charges on automatically-generated service sheets, \nthe customized list is available in the invoice.\nIf the buyer has defined a list of customized allowances and charges, Ariba Network validates that the service \ncodes entered for allowances and charges in the cXML invoice match the service codes defined in the list of \ncustomized allowances and charges. If the service codes of allowances and charges in the cXML don't match to \nthe service codes of allowances and charges defined in the buyer's list, the invoice is rejected.\nIf a buyer customizes the list of allowances and charges while a supplier has invoices in the draft state that \ncontain default allowances and charges, the supplier is prompted to use the customized list during the invoice \nsubmission.\nIf a supplier copies an existing invoice that contains default allowances and charges after the buyer customized \nthe allowances and charges list, then the customized list is available on the invoice copy during the invoice \ncreation.\n\ue05c Note\nSpecific to users in France: If the parafiscal rule is checked and the buyer has defined a customized list of \nallowances and charges, then both the customized list and the parafiscal charges are available during \ninvoice creation.\nWhen a buyer opens this link, the Ariba Network displays a page where buyers can enter allowances and \ncharges.

This allows suppliers to \ngenerate invoices from ship notices where the quantity shipped value in the invoice can differ from the \nquantities specified in the ship notice within the specified tolerance limits. Buyers can set both the upper and \nlower tolerance limits within which the suppliers are allowed to modify the shipped quantities in the generated \ninvoice.

Buyer sets the upper tolerance limit to 5% and the \nlower tolerance level to 10% for the shipped quantities in an invoice. Now, the upper tolerance level is 105 \nunits and the lower tolerance level is 90 units. Supplier can generate an invoice for the corresponding \npurchase order with the shipped quantity value ranging from 90 to 105 units.\n\ue16d Example\nThe buyer generates a purchase order for 100 units and sets the upper tolerance limit to 10% and the lower \ntolerance level to 10% for the shipped quantities in an invoice. Now, the supplier generates two ship \nnotices. The supplier specifies 30 units in the first ship notice and 70 units in the second ship notice. When \nan invoice is generated against ship notice 1, the supplier can enter a value ranging from a maximum of 33 \nunits to a minimum of 27 units in the invoice. When an invoice is generated against ship notice 2, the \nsupplier can enter a value ranging from a maximum of 77 units to a minimum of 63 units in the invoice.\n\u25cf Require references to ship notices on invoices\nThis rule allows suppliers to flip a PO to an invoice for shipped quantities.

They are also used to meet country-specific\nrequirements, including VAT.\nDigital signatures are based using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). PKI is a technique that associates electronic \ncredentials (called certificates) with two cryptographic keys that are related so that what is encoded with one can \nonly be decoded with the other. The keys cannot be derived from one another. One key (the private key) is kept \nsecret by the holder of the certificate; the other key (the public key) is published as part of the certificate. The \ncertificate is issued by a Certification Authority (CA) which uses secure processes and technology to uniquely \nidentify the certificate holder. The CA also publishes data showing whether or not a certificate has been revoked. If \nthe certificate holder uses their private key to encrypt data, then anyone holding the associated public key can \ntechnically check the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the signed data.\nDigital signatures enable buying organizations and suppliers to prove that an invoice is unaltered. If a digitally \nsigned invoice is changed after it is signed, the signature is invalid.\nAriba Network can apply a digital signature to invoices generated online, through cXML, EDI, or CSV. SAP Ariba \ncompares the originating and destination countries on the invoice to determine whether the invoice should be \ndigitally signed. If either country is listed on the SAP Ariba invoice signing matrix, Ariba Network digitally signs the \ninvoice. In some cases, Ariba Network applies digital signatures with both the originating and the destination \ncountry certificates.\nWhen an invoice meets SAP Ariba invoice signing matrix criteria, Ariba Network automatically applies the relevant \ndigital signatures to invoices regardless of how they are submitted. The supplier automatically sees the following \ntext at the top of the invoice entry page when submitting an invoice online:\nConfirm and submit this document.

In Europe and other countries where SAP Ariba \napplies a digital signature, the invoice issuers authorize SAP Ariba\u2019s subcontractor TrustWeaver AB to issue the \ne-invoices on their behalf.\n\u25cf Invoice receiver: participant who receives invoices (buyer).\nThe digital signing service provider ensures that only valid certificates are being used. This process is managed \nthrough an extensive case management system controlling issues and life cycle events in relation to keys and \ncertificates (for example, the system administrators received automated notification emails in time for appropriate \nrenewal).\nThe potential event of a confidentiality breach is covered via an incident response plan. To prevent any such case \nonly authorized administrators are allowed to log on to servers and infrastructure components using individual \naccounts. Logon is not allowed without a valid case number. All logon activities are monitored and reviewed on a \ndaily basis and verified by the Security Officer on a weekly basis. Any logon attempt (successful or unsuccessful) \nsends alerts to administrators and Security Officer. All changes to the service follow defined and approved \nchecklists and follow up adhere to defined procedures.\nThe eSigning service provider (or an authorized representative) purchases the cards from third party CAs that have \nbeen verified to issue compliant certificates following the normal order process provided by the CA in question. \nStatutorily, the eSigning service provider may be represented by the CEO or Board members. Where pseudonyms \nare available under the applicable laws of the country in question and if the CA offers this as a service for the \nappropriate certificates, the authorized representatives (or their appointees, see above) may choose to use the \neSigning service provider\u2019s name as a pseudonym.\n92 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nDigital signature process\nOnly the Authorized Representative Signatory has access and is in constant control of the physical whereabouts \nand codes of the certificate cards, both when they are slotted and when they are not slotted.\nThe authority to invalidate certificates is given to the eSigning service provider via a specific agreement, with each \ncertificate holder so that in cases of (reasonably suspected) private key compromise the deployed private key \nwould be revoked (under obligation).\nUse the following diagram to understand the process points in the workflow for setting up a Smart Card:\nCertificate/Smart Card Setup eSigning ASP/Hub", "start_char_idx": 231225, "end_char_idx": 235342, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68fd1db9-1a5e-4389-9d2d-3e0ae700bed5": {"__data__": {"id_": "68fd1db9-1a5e-4389-9d2d-3e0ae700bed5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a68ab96f-112d-444c-a349-0636e2f2cbfe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e8e2e380284679d5f444f280c636ddd5f2fa37d5b466c5b40be880b97575f5e"}, "3": {"node_id": "b26b1dfd-8293-4083-92d6-44a339ae8435", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e6620a2d06ff9d4a05f2553568c06e9698eaeb94e387b0ef795664fe61aca6b"}}, "hash": "973fe1b913f9457b18618d1653371fff2e83792b97386cc25d5ea1046820e19a", "text": "setting up a Smart Card:\nCertificate/Smart Card Setup eSigning ASP/Hub Certificate Authority (CA)\nSignatory has \nbeen identified\nIssues Smart Card \nwith Certificate \n(advanced or \nqualified)\nRequest for \nSmart Card\nSmart Card \nreceived and \nimplemented into \nS S CD + Pin \nentered\nyes\nSC 02\nSC 03\nSC 04 SC 01\nStart ASP\nFigure 9: Smart Card workflow process\nSC 01: eSigning Service Provider requests Smart Card with qualified certificate\nSC 02: CA identifies requester based on Passport or a document with equal security level\nSC 03: CA issues Smart Card with qualified certificate\nSC 04: A qualified certificate and corresponding private key is received.

SAT also mandates the use \nof a defined XML invoice format known as Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) as the only acceptable \ninvoice document format. With the SAT-authorized electronic invoicing process in Mexico, it is mandatory for \nsuppliers in Mexico to have an accredited e-invoicing solution provider to create and generate invoices and an \norganization that facilitates in providing authorized digital signatures required for the invoices. These organizations \nare called Proveedor Autorizado de Certificaci\u00b4n (PACs).\n\ue05c Note\nElectronic invoicing regulations in Mexico do not apply to cross-border invoices.\nMexican suppliers can submit invoices in Mexico through manual upload of a CFDI invoice (that was cleared in the \nsuppliers' ERP or their other in-house systems) using a wizard in Ariba Network. For more information, see How to \nupload CFDI and PDF invoices [page 113].\nAriba Network converts the uploaded invoice into cXML and validates it against an authorized service. Buyers can \nreceive the invoice with the electronic stamped CFDI and a PDF version that are available on the supplier\u2019s Ariba \nNetwork account. Suppliers then send it to the buyer\u2019s system through Ariba Network after passing all the business \nvalidations set by each buyer.\nMexico tax invoice extrinsic fields [page 111]\nAddenda [page 113]\nHow to upload CFDI and PDF invoices [page 113]\nSupport for payment receipts (Complemento de Pago) [page 114]\nMexico tax invoice extrinsic fields\nThe cXML invoice document for Mexico contains the following extrinsic fields:\nTable 2: cXML extrinsic fields\nExtrinsic Name This Field Stores...\ntaxInvoiceNumber (UUID) The UUID allocated by PAC is required for tax purposes and \nshould be stored in the ERP/accounting system.\ntaxStampingDate Date on which the document was stamped by a PAC.\npaymentMethod The details of the mode of payment.

External \ntax invoice handling allows buyers to apply a specific set of Ariba Network transaction rules to all external tax \ninvoices irrespective of the supplier that is referenced in the invoice. This set of configurable transaction rules is \ncalled External Tax Invoice Rules. The configured external tax invoice rules are applied only to external electronic \ntax invoices.\nTo prevent automatic invoice field validations, buyers typically would like to have less stringent rules for external tax \ninvoices than for regular invoices.\n\u25cf Buyers are given the option to configure a set of invoice rules to be applied to all external tax invoices.\n\u25cf Buyers can configure transaction rules for external tax invoices by creating supplier groups and configuring\nappropriate rules for such groups.\nThe following table summarizes what Ariba Network does with external tax invoices and regular invoices when a \nbuyer account has external tax invoice rules configured.\nInvoice Scenario Supplier Is in a Supplier Group Ariba Network Action\nAny external tax invoice Does not matter Applies external tax invoice rules\nRegular invoice created in Ariba Network Yes Applies group-specific transaction rules\nNo Applies default transaction rules\nWorkflow for external tax invoice handling\nWhen a buyer's account in Ariba Network is configured to use external tax invoice rules:\n1.

In addition, tax regulations in Hungary require suppliers to present tax \ninvoice reports for auditing purposes.\nFrom July 1, 2018, suppliers in Hungary must report all invoices that exceed a VAT of 100,000 Hungarian Forint \n(HUF) to the Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration", "start_char_idx": 283534, "end_char_idx": 287463, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3254965d-cffb-492e-b0a4-b27d3d79ae20": {"__data__": {"id_": "3254965d-cffb-492e-b0a4-b27d3d79ae20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "293d18fa-e36b-4f81-ac59-a3235c18d213", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc2ed6961cc8045790faba29148de4768b48101ae2d6951cbda271e22aefc931"}, "3": {"node_id": "6549b893-3c7a-4860-9588-067c2485a6ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a8d053e1134105c0640036a1ea5d478c32a4d8100defcb3238924c82862a309"}}, "hash": "dce7ee1c3499bb87f3bd15524988c8536cfd703db040cf6fc8a7fef341e52171", "text": "Hungarian Forint \n(HUF) to the Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration (NAV). This is a mandatory tax regulation \ninitiated by the NAV in Hungary. The NAV is an online system. The invoicing system used by suppliers to create \ninvoices (Ariba Network), must report such invoices online to the NAV immediately after the invoices are issued. \nKeeping in line with this tax requirement, invoices issued by suppliers in Hungary are reported to the NAV through \nthe Ariba Network interface.\nAriba Network does not report invoices with VAT less than 100,000 HUF to the NAV. However, there is no regulation \nthat discourages reporting invoices with less than or equal to 100,000 HUF.\nThis is applicable only to domestic invoices, where suppliers and buyers (or their tax representatives) are located in \nHungary. This regulation makes it compulsory to report only mandatory invoice fields to the NAV.\nThe National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary introduced version 1.1 of the format supported by the \nonline invoicing system. This version is effective from May 02, 2019. For more information see Schema update \nversion 1.1 [page 121].\nSalient features\nThe salient features in Ariba Network to tax invoicing in Hungary are listed below:\n\u25cf Hungarian suppliers can create a tax profile with details of:\n\u25cb Locations\n\u25cb Associated Tax and VAT IDs\n\u25cb Folio ranges with numbers that are associated with each invoice\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 119\n\u25cf Hungarian buyers can provide their Tax IDs and intra-EU VAT IDs in their Ariba Network profiles.\n\u25cf Tax Determination Date - Suppliers can specify this date on the invoice header. This is the date from which tax \nis due. The date can be a past or a future date, and is mandatory. If this field is not populated, the invoice date \nis considered for the tax invoice report.\n\u25cf Tax invoice number association - An invoice that is received by or created in Ariba Network is assigned a tax \ninvoice number from an active folio range.\n\u25cf Sending tax invoices to TrustWeaver for electronic signing. The signed invoices are then propagated to buyers.\n\u25cf Hungarian suppliers can download tax invoice summary reports for auditing purposes.\nPrerequisites for suppliers\n\u25cf Hungarian suppliers must configure their SAP Ariba accounts before they can submit tax invoices.\n\u25cf Users must be logged in as administrator to make configuration changes.\n\u25cf Before creating invoices, Hungarian suppliers must specify the supplier's country of origin as Hungary on the \nCompany Profile page of their SAP Ariba account.\n\u25cf Supplier organizations must register at the NAV portal and generate their Technical User ID, Password, \nSignature Key, and Replacement Key and provide these details in their Ariba Network user accounts.\n\u25cf If supplier organizations do not have their VAT ID, they must enter the tax ID of their tax representative in the \nregulatory profile section.\nPrerequisites for buyers\n\u25cf Users must be logged in as administrator to make configuration changes.\n\u25cf The buyer administer must enable the following five Hungary specific country based rules:\n\u25cb Require tax amounts in local currency.\n\u25cb Require subtotal and amount due in local currency.\n\u25cb Determine local currency based on supplier country.\n\u25cb Require detailed tax information in tax summaries.\n\u25cb Require suppliers to choose from your list of valid tax values.\n\ue05c Note\nIf any of the preceding five Hungary specific country based rules are unchecked, Ariba Network may fail to \nreport invoices with VAT exceeding 100,000 HUF to NAV, and may result in gaps in the folio number \nsequence.\nInformation about Ariba Network invoicing software\nHungarian suppliers using Ariba Network to create invoices in Ariba Network may need the following information. \nHowever, there is no general registration requirement for Ariba Network or for suppliers using Ariba Network.\n120 C", "start_char_idx": 287470, "end_char_idx": 291391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6549b893-3c7a-4860-9588-067c2485a6ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "6549b893-3c7a-4860-9588-067c2485a6ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d9d04be-dfea-43b5-a7d4-7ae9d88f9af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec3ae8e7145f0c90695a66c70d38d156299f32d178d7a0d783ec4ffbc7b82d7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3254965d-cffb-492e-b0a4-b27d3d79ae20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dce7ee1c3499bb87f3bd15524988c8536cfd703db040cf6fc8a7fef341e52171"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2bf3007-8df2-404d-86bf-d8bd7c41b26c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d00b08adf3c8c158f9917802ef1ec8dc5edb5a2314d2ccca6d6bf3687e19375e"}}, "hash": "2a8d053e1134105c0640036a1ea5d478c32a4d8100defcb3238924c82862a309", "text": "for Ariba Network or for suppliers using Ariba Network.\n120 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process\n\u25cf Software name: Ariba Network\n\u25cf Software ID: SAPARIBA-AN-201807\n\u25cf Developer name: SAP SE\n\u25cf Developer VAT ID: DE 143454214\n\u25cf Name of the seller: (for example) SAP Hungary Ltd.\n\u25cf VAT ID of the seller: (for example) 12342659-2-44\n\u25cf System name: SAPARIBA-AN-201807\n\u25cf System accessibility: https://service.ariba.com/Supplier.aw\nLimitations\n\u25cf The report can be downloaded only for a period of three months at a time.

If an invoice has been reported to NAV with version 1.0, the invoice can be \nmodified (corrected) using version 1.1 of the NAV schema. However, the converse is not true. In \nother words, if an invoice has been reported to NAV in version 1.1, the invoice cannot be modified\nusing version 1.0.\nRequest version The requestVersion tag will include version 1.1 instead of version 1.0 with the introduction of \nthe new schema.\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 121\nValid VAT rate percen\u0002tages\nNAV mandates that only the following VAT rates are valid and authorized in Hungary: 5%, 7%, \n12%, 18%, 20%, 25%, and 27%. However, for goods and services that are exempt from VAT, sup\u0002pliers must enter 0% as the VAT rate.

With version 1.1 of the NAV reporting \nschema, NAV has introduced a few new warning messages. A few existing warning messages have \nalso been updated for greater clarity. These warning messages will be displayed in the History tab \nof the invoice in Ariba Network.\nUnique line item number \nreference\nWhile creating line item credit memos, integrated suppliers must ensure that the line item number \nreference is unique.\nCorrection and storno invoices\nIn Hungary, the correction invoice option allows you to create correction invoices for products or services that were \npreviously invoiced, but need amendments. The need for amendments may arise as a result of incorrect \n122 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process\ninformation provided in the original invoice, or because of changes that have occurred to the quantities, prices or \ntax amounts.\nWhen you make a correction to a previous invoice or if you reverse (storno) it, according to legal regulations, you \nmust create a correction invoice or reversal invoice depending on the type of change.\nCorrection invoice: A correction invoice is issued when a previously issued invoice needs to be corrected. The \ncorrections may be needed to change the item quantity, tax amount, and so on. A correction invoice in Hungary \ncontains:\n\u25cf Correction Invoice as the invoice header label (title).

Suppliers can annul invoices that were \nincorrectly reported to NAV (and were subsequently rejected or failed in Ariba Network) by using an option in Ariba \nNetwork. Annulled invoices cannot be edited, or re-submitted to NAV. For information on how to annul an invoice, \nsee How to annul an invoice [page 127].\nHow to set up a regulatory profile for Hungarian suppliers\nContext\nRegulatory profiles refer to supplier accounts registered with the tax authorities in Hungary for electronic invoicing \nprocedures. Suppliers in Hungary can have multiple VAT IDs. However, one VAT ID can have only one regulatory \nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 123\nprofile associated with it. The Set Up Legal Profile check box is available to suppliers in Hungary. Ariba Network \ndisplays the Set Up Legal Profile check box only if you have selected the Country as Hungary.\n\ue05c Note\nAll the existing (legacy) regulatory profiles associated with a supplier's VAT ID are migrated to the Legal Profile\npage. When you create the first regulatory profile, you will be asked to confirm if you wish to migrate your \nexisting regulatory profiles. The current enhancement facilitates the creation of new regulatory profiles in Ariba \nNetwork.\nProcedure\n1. Click Company Settings Company Profile .\n2. Go to Additional Company Addresses section and click Create to configure additional supplier addresses.\n3. Enter the following required fields in the Address Name section :\n\u25cb Address Name - Supplier's company address\n\u25cb VAT ID - Supplier's VAT ID\n\u25cb Tax ID\nSupplier VAT ID can contain a maximum of 20 digits. It must begin with HU, and must be followed by a \nminimum of 8 digits.\nTax ID is an 8-digit numeric value. You cannot have same Tax ID for different supplier profiles.\n4. Enter the following required fields in the Address section:\n\u25cb Address 2 - Your company's additional branch address in Hungary.\n\u25cb Postal Code - This is a four digit number.\n\u25cb Country\n5. Select the Set Up Legal Profile check box.\nResults\nThe regulatory profile for the VAT ID is created, and suppliers can now set up tax invoice number ranges for this \nregulatory profile. After a standard invoice or line item credit memo is submitted, Ariba Network processes these \ninvoices sequentially and assigns a folio number that is configured in the regulatory profile. This number is \ncaptured in the taxInvoiceNumber extrinsic. The document is then sent to TrustWeaver for digital signing.\nHow to set up a tax invoice number range\nContext\nA tax invoice number range (also called a folio) is a range of numbers that a supplier defines in Ariba Network. \nWhen a standard tax invoice is created, Ariba Network automatically assigns a number sequentially from the active \n124 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process\nrange to the invoice.

In such cases, invoices issued by \nsuppliers are proforma invoices. Proforma invoices are abridged or estimated invoices that contain only essential \ninformation for buyers, and cannot be considered as a request for payment. Ariba Network provides a check box to \nallow suppliers to opt out of NAV reporting. To opt out of NAV reporting, follow these steps:\nProcedure\n1. Click Company Settings Electronic Invoice Routing Tax Invoicing and Archiving .\n2. Scroll down to Tax Invoicing for Hungary.\n3. Select the box Disable Tax Invoicing for Hungary.\nWhen you check this box, your invoices will not be reported to the NAV, and will therefore not represent a tax \ninvoice according to the tax regulations in Hungary.

in France and enforced by French law.\nThe idea of the parafiscal taxes is to create dedicated funds for different causes. When selling particular products, \nFrench sellers are obliged to collect parafiscal taxes for specific purposes, which they ultimately pay to a third party, \nresponsible for investing the funds according to their purpose. For example, if a customer buys a polluting product \nfrom a French seller, then this customer has to pay an environment tax.\nAriba Network allows French suppliers to add parafiscal taxes on both line and header level. Parafisal taxes can be \nadded to non-PO invoices and credit memos.

A supplier creates an invoice.\n2. The supplier's default address is French or the supplier updates the address on the invoice to a French address.\n\ue05c Note\nParafiscal taxes can only be added to invoices if the supplier address is French.\n3. The supplier adds a charge to the header or to a line item.\n4. The supplier selects Parafiscal Tax from the list of available charges and fills in the necessary information for \nthe parafiscal tax. Optionally, the supplier adds a VAT tax to the parafiscal tax.\n5. The supplier completes and sends the invoice.\n6. The buyer receives the invoice and views the parafiscal tax information.\nFrench tax invoicing audit reports\nAudit reports in France for buyers and suppliers exchanging invoices electronically.\nAriba Network provides audit reports for French buyers and French suppliers who exchange invoices electronically. \nSummary List and Partner File reports are commonly used by French organizations to facilitate the tax invoicing \nprocess. The reports are required by French tax authorities when trading partners use the EDI method of \nexchanging invoices according to Article 289 3\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code. Otherwise, the default method \nused by SAP Ariba is the digital signature according to Article 289 2\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code. The Ariba \nNetwork generates the reports automatically regardless of the methods used.\nThe reports are fiscal objects, which provide information about the French tax invoices, exchanged between trading \npartners. They are maintained per VAT ID and they are generated automatically in the Ariba Network. If a buyer or a \nsupplier user has more than one VAT ID, several reports are generated for them - one for each VAT ID. Every VAT ID \nis associated with one or more addresses. Buyers and suppliers on the Ariba Network can add as many addresses \nand VAT IDs, as they need. They can also enter unique names for each address, so they can easily differentiate\nbetween them. Each VAT ID, together with its address(es) and address name is considered a single legal entity. The \nheader of each French Summary List and Partner File report contains information about the legal entity, for which it \nhas been generated. This legal entity is the report owner.\nBoth the French Summary List and the Partner File reports are generated in PDF format and they are digitally \nsigned and archived. The signed PDF files, together with signature verification files, are sent to the SAP Ariba Long\u0002Term Document Archiving service for the corresponding buyer and supplier. Archived reports can be accessed on \nthe Document Archive page. The retention time of the reports in the Document Archive depends on the time, set \nfor France in the SAP Ariba Tax Archiving Framework. To check the retention time for France, go to the Ariba Terms \nCenter , click Country Coverage under Terms and Policies for Services, and find the Retention Period for \nFrance.\nThe French Summary List and Partner File reports are used for auditing purposes and they are required by French \ntax authorities when the EDI method of exchanging invoices is used.

Reports are generated every day and they contain all invoices \ntransacted on the previous day. If no invoices were sent or received by the legal entity for a given day, no report is \ngenerated. Each report file can contain up to 1,000 invoices. If more than 1,000 invoices are transacted on a given \nday, the contents of the report are split into multiple files.\nEach French Summary List report contains a header and a body in a table format. The header contains the legal \nentity information of the report owner, including the owner's role - buyer or supplier. The body contains a table \nlisting all invoices that have been received or sent by the report owner, depending on the role. Each row from the \ntable contains information for a single invoice, like the invoice number, the date when it was issued and the total \namount of the invoice.

Configuring country based invoice rules overrides the default transaction rules.\nProcedure\n1. In the upper right corner of the page, click Manage Profile.\n2. On the ConfiJuratLon page, click Country-based Invoice Rules.\n3. Click the Select Country pull-down menu and select Singapore.\n4. Click Add Country Rules.\n5. Go to the section PO and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules.\n6. Configure the rules as applicable to your business.\nSee the Prerequisites section for more information on the rules to be configured.\nTax invoicing in countries that require credit memo \ncreation when discounts are accepted\nMany countries with Value Added Tax (VAT) or similar indirect taxes require suppliers to issue credit memos when a \nbuyer and supplier agree to an early payment discount after a tax invoice has been issued.\nBuyers can configure Ariba Network to automatically generate credit memos that align to your original tax invoice. \nThese dynamic discounting credit memos are generated at the time of payment, upon receipt of the buyer \nremittance. The credit memo copies content from the original tax invoice, adjust taxable amount, prices, and tax \namount using the discount %, and applies any country-specific e-signatures or business rules. You can use the \nEarly Payment (details) report to make tax adjustments, and may archive the automatically generated dynamic \ndiscounting credit memo cXML and PDF through the Archive Zip process or SAP Ariba's archiving service.\nThe automatic generation of credit memos functionality is enabled by your buyer and confirmed by you. For more \ninformation about dynamic discounting credit memos, see Managing discounts.\n164 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nCountr\\\u0010specLfic tax invoicing process\nTimestamp verLficatLon of invoices in Japan\nInvoices in Japan must be timestamped and verified by government approved service providers to ensure \nauthenticity and integrity of invoices.\nAriba Network interacts with timestamp service providers such as Seiko to timestamp and verify invoices in Japan. \nSuppliers, buyers, or auditors appointed by the National Tax Authority can submit invoices from Ariba Network to \ntimestamp and further verify the invoices. In addition, buyers and suppliers enable auditors to verify invoices by \ncreating special user profiles for them in Ariba Network.\nCross border and domestic transactions\nTransactions in Ariba Network are considered 'cross border' transactions if either the buyer or the supplier is \noutside of a country. If both the buyer and supplier are from within the country, the transactions are considered \ndomestic transactions.\nAccording to the eDocument Act in Japan, every invoice that is associated with a cross border transaction or a \ndomestic transaction must be timestamped and verified by a service provider.\nInvoices in Japan are required to be:\n1. Timestamped\n2. Made available for verification\nTimestamping of invoices\nInvoices are automatically sent to Seiko when administrators configure a rule in Ariba Network to enable \ntimestamping and verification of invoices. The timestamping vendor, Seiko, attaches a timestamp token to each \ninvoice and sends the invoices back to Ariba Network. The timestamp token can be used in future to detect any \ntampering of invoice data.\nVerLficatLon of invoices\nSeiko sends the timestamped invoices back to Ariba Network.

For example, if Subtotal is $1.235, Total Tax is calculated for $1.24.\nAriba Network uses the following algorithm to calculate Total Tax:\n1. For each Tax Category at the invoice line level, it rounds Total Tax to the same number of decimal places as the \ncurrency\u2019s minor unit precision.\n2. It adds all Tax Categories in a particular invoice line and that total becomes the total tax of that line.\n3.

For e-invoices to be recognized on an equivalent audit basis as paper \ninvoices for value-added tax (VAT) or similar indirect taxes, most countries require e-invoices to meet the \nrequirements for content, authenticity, integrity, and archiving. Failure to meet such requirements can lead to \nsanctions, including fines and the possibility of buyers having to repay already deducted VAT.\nImplementing a cost-effective tax compliant e-invoicing system requires a holistic approach that takes into account \ntechnical, process, and legal aspects of a corporation's invoice processes throughout the relevant disciplines in the \ncompany. However, the approach must be driven by a tax perspective, which means first deciding on the desired \noutcome of an audit process and then designing the system from the resulting requirements.\nTrading partner tax responsibilities and liabilities\nSAP Ariba does not play a tax advisor role. When a Trading Partner uses a Service Provider, it does not transfer its \ntax responsibilities or liabilities to the Service Provider.\nTax authorities offer system audits to the taxable customer. These audits typically address the \u201cend to end\u201d \nprocess. SAP Ariba supports reviews of its components by offering process documentation and technical advisory \nservices. However, SAP Ariba cannot support non-SAP Ariba components or processes such as tax reports \ngenerated in the Trading Partners\u2019 AP/ERP systems.\nIn Europe, local Tax Authorities don't deliver formal certification/authorization letters to providers of e-invoicing \nfeatures like SAP Ariba. For legal and regulatory compliance, each Trading Partner needs to, at its own expense, \nperform the following tasks:\n\u25cf Obtain all necessary regulatory approvals applicable to its business.\n\u25cf Obtain any necessary permits for its business and comply in all material respects with all laws and regulatory \nrequirements applicable.\nSAP Ariba makes no representation as to whether its e-invoicing features satisfy the applicable legal requirements \nregarding tax. Customers should consult with their tax and legal advisor on such issues.\n200 C O N F I D E N T I A L\nAriba Network guide to invoicing\nAriba Network global e-invoicing\nRevision history\nThe following table provides a brief history of the updates to this guide.
