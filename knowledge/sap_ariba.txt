Ariba Network invoicing
Ariba Network is a hosted service that enables a company to form relationships with their suppliers and conduct 
order and invoicing transactions over the Internet. Buying organizations use Ariba Network to find suppliers from 
which they want to purchase products or services and invite suppliers to form trading relationships. After a supplier 
has been enabled on the Ariba Network, the buying organization can view any public catalogs the supplier has 
created or receive customer-specific catalogs from their suppliers. Buyers can then place orders, and suppliers in 
turn can create order-based invoices.
If the buyer allows, suppliers can also create invoices that are not based on a purchase order or enable a supplier to 
punch into the buyer’s invoicing system to create contract-based invoices.
Buyer customers use one of the following invoicing solutions to connect to the Ariba Network:
● An SAP Ariba cloud solution: SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management
● An SAP Ariba on premise solution: Ariba Buyer with the Ariba Invoice module
● Ariba Invoice Automation, which connects an external ERP to the Ariba Network to exchange cXML documents 
via one of the supported Ariba Network adapters.
Through Ariba Network, buyers and suppliers can seamlessly integrate their invoicing processes on a single 
network.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 7
Figure 1: e-Invoice: architecture and services
Suppliers can either create invoices online in their Ariba Network account or submit them electronically from their 
external system via cXML or EDI. If suppliers create invoices online, then the account administrator can assign 
specific roles to users that allow them to view purchase orders and create invoices.
All invoices regardless how they are submitted to Ariba Network are validated against the specific buyer’s invoicing 
rules. Invoices that fail that validation are rejected. Only after they are accepted by Ariba Network are they then 
digitally signed (if required based on the From and To country on the invoice).
Once the invoices are validated and signed, they are downloaded to the buyer’s invoicing system for review and 
approval. If the buyer finds a discrepancy (e.g. between the expected and actual tax amount or a line item invoice to 
purchase order mismatch) they can then dispute or reject the invoice and require the supplier to resubmit a 
corrected invoice.

SAP Ariba security practices
The SAP Ariba solution components support general commercial good security practices that ensure 
confidentiality, security and integrity of the business system. SAP Ariba’s current audit report is the WebTrust 
(http://www.webtrust.org ) seal. SAP Ariba is audited against this standard every six months by an external 
independent auditor for its cloud solutions including the Ariba Network.
8 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing
The certification provides reasonable assurance that, based on the AICPA/CA Trust Services Criteria for Security 
Confidentiality, Availability and Processing Integrity Criteria:
● the systems are protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical);
● the systems are available for operation and use as committed or agreed;
● the system processing is complete, accurate, timely and authorized;
● information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed; and
● SAP Ariba has complied with its commitments regarding security, availability, processing integrity, and 
confidentiality.
SAP Ariba ensures the integrity of invoice data transmitted between Ariba Network and the SAP Ariba invoicing 
solutions through Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Invoicing prerequisites
The enablement for invoicing in Ariba Network is a buyer-driven process that follows these steps:
1. If the supplier does not have an account on the Ariba Network, they either create an account in Ariba Network 
or take ownership of an account that the buyer has pre-enabled for them. No matter how a supplier starts 
using the Ariba Network resources, they first must register and accept the Terms of Use. Acceptance of the 
Terms of Use is required for all users of a supplier account, regardless if they are the account administrator or a 
user of the supplier company granted access to the account.
The Terms of Use for suppliers is available for review on http://supplier.ariba.com on the bottom of the page.
2. The supplier and buyer establish the trading relationship.
 Note
Steps 1 and 2 are recorded with a date (“Network TC Acceptance Date” and “Relationship Status-Last 
Update”) and can be downloaded as part of the buyer side “Supplier Account History” report.
3. The buyer configures their Ariba Network account to accept invoices from the supplier and specifies specific
invoice rules that the supplier-submitted invoices must adhere to. By default, these rules govern invoices from 
all suppliers, however buyers can override these rules for specific groups of suppliers or by country.
4. The supplier reviews the buyer-specific invoice rules under “Customer Relationships” details in the supplier 
account.
Invoice rules
Buyers must specifically allow authorized suppliers to create invoices using the Ariba Network user interface or to 
transmit them from their own back end system through the Ariba Network. If a buyer has disabled the invoicing 
feature for some suppliers, then those suppliers will not have access to the invoicing functionality when reviewing 
the buyer’s purchase orders and they will not be able to enter non-PO invoices for those buyers. If attempts are 
made by a supplier to send automated invoices using cXML or EDI, those invoices will be automatically rejected.
After a supplier is authorized to send invoices electronically to a buyer, those invoices will be validated against the 
buyer’s configured invoice rules. The rules established on the Ariba Network require that suppliers and buyers 
exchange invoices and invoice status updates that contain the specific content for a wide range of requirements, 
including VAT compliance. When a supplier user creates invoices in the Ariba Network user interface, the fields and 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 9
validations available to them on the user interface are controlled by the invoice rules that the buyer has configured.
If they send invoices through cXML or EDI, the same invoice rules apply and invoices that don’t fulfill the specific
criteria set forth by the invoice rules will be rejected.
Testing the invoice process
Test accounts are free Ariba Network accounts that allow buyers and suppliers to test purchase order and invoice 
exchange (routing, creation, and processing). These test accounts enable transaction partners to send and receive 
test purchase orders and invoices without the risk of actually shipping products or disrupting production 
transactions.
Test accounts provide a safe way for new and existing buyers and suppliers to exercise Ariba Network. New buyers 
typically spend several days testing their procurement systems and Ariba Network configurations. Similarly, new 
suppliers spend several days testing their order receiving system and Ariba Network configurations. Buyers and 
suppliers also use test accounts when testing their new trading relationships.
Both buyers and suppliers use test accounts, not production accounts, for this testing. When they are confident
that the purchase order and invoice processes are working, they switch from their test accounts to their production 
accounts.
To perform testing, buyers and suppliers must coordinate with each other. Both buyer and supplier must use either 
test accounts or production accounts; the two types will not communicate with each other.
For more information on test accounts, see the topic "Using Test Accounts in Ariba Network" in the Product 
Documentation > For Administrators section of the Learning Center.
Ariba Network invoicing—buyer’s perspective
After a trading relationship has been established with a supplier in Ariba Network, buyers can download catalogs 
from their suppliers and then use their procurement application to generate purchase orders. Procurement 
applications send purchase orders to Ariba Network, which either stores them for suppliers to pick up or routes 
them to suppliers through one of several protocols. Suppliers can respond with order confirmations, ship notices, 
and invoices.
It is the buyer’s responsibility to allow invoicing by setting invoice rules. By enabling the appropriate invoice rules, 
buyers can allow suppliers to:
● Create standard invoices against purchase orders.
● Create non-PO invoices and credit memos.
● Create invoices against contracts by accessing the customers’ contract collaboration sites.
Ariba Network automatically routes purchase orders to suppliers through cXML, email, fax, or EDI. Working with an 
SAP Ariba representative, buyers can also customize the Ariba Network supplier user interface to allow suppliers to 
upload invoices in CSV (comma-separated value) format. Suppliers specify their preferred order routing method, 
and Ariba Network takes care of the format, protocol, and delivery details.

Invoice rules [page 54]
Viewing invoices
While buyers can view their suppliers’ invoices in their Ariba Network online Inbox, most buyer users review and 
approve the invoices in their own invoicing solution. Generally, an account administrator might need to review 
invoices that for some reason cannot be downloaded to the buyer’s invoicing solution and then resend stuck 
invoices after resolving the issue.
The Invoices section of the Inbox shows details about each invoice, including columns showing the invoice routing 
method, origin, and source document (or order type). The transactions list can be configured to show failed 
invoices, show or hide columns, group transactions by column, export tables to spreadsheet applications such as 
Microsoft Excel, and control the number of transactions displayed (the default is 100).
Buyer users can also use the cXML Viewer at https://service-2.ariba.com/Buyer.aw/ad/displayInvoice to upload 
a file containing the cXML invoice to generate a human-readable representation of the actual invoice data.
Editing invoices sent from an Invoice Conversion Service
SAP Ariba invoice conversion services (ICS) solutions facilitate conversion of paper invoices to an electronic format 
using a process that includes validation. An invoice conversion service provider receives paper invoices on behalf of 
the buying organization and converts them to an electronic format for posting to Ariba Network. Invoices sent from 
such service providers are labeled ICS Paper Invoices in the Ariba Network inbox.
Buyers who subscribe to an ICS solution can edit and resubmit unassigned invoices on Ariba Network. An 
unassigned invoice is an ICS invoice with an unknown supplier, which means Ariba Network either did not find a 
purchase order matching the invoice or cannot verify the supplier ID.
Buyers can also edit and resubmit ICS invoices rejected by their Ariba Network invoice rules or by their invoicing 
application.
Ariba Network invoicing—supplier’s perspective
Suppliers in Ariba Network have two options for generating electronic invoices:
● manually, using the Generate Invoice feature provided in Ariba Network
● programmatically, using cXML or EDI
To generate invoices manually, suppliers do not need to do any special setup once buyers are prepared to receive 
invoices. Suppliers can generate invoices and credit memos online in their Ariba Network account, or use their own 
systems to generate cXML or EDI invoices and route them through Ariba Network. To generate invoices 
programmatically, suppliers must work with buyers to understand their special requirements for invoice 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 11
configuration. Also, suppliers must ensure that the date format conforms to the ISO 8601 standard supported by 
Ariba Network.
For more information about supplier account configuration for cXML or EDI, see the &onʥJuULnJ document routing 
topics in the supplier’s help center.
Invoice routing methods
Suppliers must configure their Ariba Network account to choose the routing method for invoices. The account 
administrator or users with the cXML Configuration permission (only for suppliers using cXML), or the Transaction 
Configuration permission can set routing methods for invoices.
EDI order routing requires activation by SAP Ariba Customer Support.
Payment remittance options include online (through the Ariba Network Inbox), cXML, or email.
Ariba Network user permissions

Invoice creation process
Use the following diagram to understand the workflow of how an invoice is created and then managed by Ariba 
Network, the supplier, and the buyer throughout its lifecycle:
Figure 2: High-level invoice creation process
1) Supplier creates invoice
A supplier creates an invoice in one of two ways:
● by posting a cXML (via HTTPS) or EDI message (via VAN or AS2), at which point the invoice data is directly 
transmitted to the Ariba Network, or
● by logging in to their Ariba Network account and then using the Generate Invoice feature to create an online 
invoice form (PO Invoice, Non-PO Invoice or Credit Memo). Alternately, a supplier can upload a CSV file with 
invoice data.
14 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing
2) Ariba Network validates invoice
Ariba Network processes the invoice as follows:
● The invoice data is converted into cXML; Ariba Network validates it using buyer-specified and standard rules.
● If the invoice fails validation [page 16], it is rejected and Ariba Network sends an email notification to the 
supplier.
● Supplier reviews errors, corrects invoice data and then resubmits.
● If required, Ariba Network electronically signs the invoice and stores the signature along with a verification
protocol.
● The invoice is made available for download or is pushed to the buyer’s system.
3) Buyer receives invoice
The buyer manages the invoice within their invoicing solution as follows:
● The buyer receives (or downloads) the invoice and begins the process of invoice reconciliation.
● If errors occur, the Invoice History page displays the status and reason.
● Ariba Network tracks and logs status changes and sends notifications to the supplier.
4) Supplier reviews invoice status
Based on the result of the invoice reconciliation, the supplier manages the invoice in Ariba Network as follows:
● The supplier reviews status updates.
● In case of errors, the supplier corrects invoice data, which might result in credit notes and /or new invoices.
5) Ariba archives invoice
After successful completion of the invoice reconciliation process, the invoice is scheduled for payment. Next, Ariba 
Network manages the invoice as follows:
● If configured, the buyer and supplier can archive their invoices in ZIP format.
● Buyer and supplier can downloaded the archives manually or configure their Ariba Network account to deliver 
them automatically using HTTPS post.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Introducing Ariba Network invoicing C O N F I D E N T I A L 15
Invoice validation
Ariba Network validates invoices according to the buyer-configured rules and rejects invoices that do not pass 
validation. Invoice validation depends on how a supplier generates invoices:
● Online—Ariba Network validates online invoices during data entry and displays onscreen messages for any 
errors that must be corrected. Ariba Network enforces validation of customer invoice rules by customizing the 
online display of editable and read-only content.
● cXML—Ariba Network validates cXML invoices against the cXML DTD to ensure proper format and syntax. If 
the invoice passes syntax validation, the supplier receives a cXML response with a 201 status. If the invoice fails 
validation, the supplier receives a 500 status and details of the errors. Then, Ariba Network validates them 
against the buyer’s invoice rules.
● CSV—Ariba Network converts CSV invoices to cXML. Ariba Network will provide suppliers with the necessary 
templates for formatting CSV invoices. Ariba Network checks the CSV invoices against the buyer’s invoice 
format during the import process. If the invoice does not have the proper format, Ariba Network issues a 
detailed error message. After successful import, Ariba Network converts the invoices to cXML and validates 
them against the buyer’s invoice rules.
● EDI—Ariba Network validates EDI invoices against the ANSI X12 or EDIFACT standard. If the invoice passes 
validation, Ariba Network issues a positive Functional Acknowledgement. If the invoice fails validation, Ariba 
Network issues a negative Functional Acknowledgment with details of the errors. It then converts invoices to 
cXML and validates them against the buyer’s invoice rules.
Buyers can use purchase order control keys to override invoice rules. For instance, buyers can use control keys to 
allow their suppliers to create invoices directly from service orders without a service sheet.
Suppliers can review the rules that have been specified by the buyer for invoice transactions in the Customer 
Details page of their Ariba Network account (Customer Relationships > Customer Details).

Creating invoices
Ariba Network supports the creation, validation, and routing of electronic invoices and credit memos. These 
invoices are detailed statements of products delivered or services rendered, and associated charges for one or 
more purchase orders or contracts. Ariba Network supports invoicing for material items (goods), general service 
items labor service items, and service items that require a service sheet.
See the following for more information:
● For information about invoicing rules, see Invoice rules [page 54].
● For more information on how invoicing rules affect the available fields in invoice forms, see Ariba Network 
invoice rules and fields [page 189].
● For suppliers: For information about how to create and manage invoices, see the Creating and managing 
invoices topics.
Types of invoices
Ariba Network supports the creation of the numerous types of invoices.
Invoice type Description
Material Also called purchase order-based, these are standard invoices routed through Ariba Network that do not contain any service lines (lines that require a service sheet).
Service Another type of standard invoice, these are based on service sheets that suppliers create 
from service lines in service purchase orders routed through Ariba Network. Service sheets 
and service invoices can include both services and material goods.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 17
Invoice type Description
Lean Service These are invoices routed through Ariba Network. A single invoice can be created for all the 
Lean Service line items in a purchase order.
Non-PO These invoices reference purchase orders that were not routed through Ariba Network. 
Non-PO invoices also allow suppliers to invoice purchase orders that have expired and 
been deleted, or to generate an invoice that does not have a corresponding purchase order. 
Non-PO invoices can be issued to a buying organization even if the supplier doesn’t already 
have an active trading relationship with the buying organization. In that case, the buyer 
provides the supplier with buyer customer code to allow sending a non-PO invoice (quick 
enablement through invoice).
Credit memo A credit memo represents an amount owed to a buyer by a supplier, typically from an earlier transaction such as a purchase order or a contract invoice. The amount due is a negative number.
There are four types of credit memos: PO-based header level credit memos, PO-based 
line-level credit memos, non-PO credit memos, and dynamic discounting credit memos.
Line-level credit memos can be based on a change in quantity or a price adjustment (price 
decrease).
Line-level debit memo Line-level debit memos represent an amount owed to a supplier by a buyer from an earlier 
transaction. Line-level debit memos are always due to a price adjustment (price increase).
Blanket purchase order based A blanket purchase order (BPO) is a type of contract that buyers create that forms an 
agreement to spend a specific amount with a supplier for critical items or services. If the 
blanket purchase order is used to purchase specific items (item level BPO), and the customer has not enabled their invoicing site or the BPO for collaborative invoicing, then suppliers can create an invoice directly from the BPO the same way as they can from a regular 
purchase order. If the BPO is a catalog, supplier level or commodity contract, and the buyers are either not using an SAP Ariba invoicing solution, or are using an SAP Ariba invoicing 
solutions for which collaborative invoicing has been disabled, then suppliers can view the 
BPO, but must create a non-PO invoice with the contract ID as reference to invoice against 
the BPO.
Contract-based A buying organization using an SAP Ariba invoicing solution can allow collaborative invoicing for suppliers. In that case, suppliers punch in to the buyer’s invoicing solution to either 
create the entire invoice in the buyer’s invoicing site, or they punch in to retrieve the contract information and add items from the contract to the invoice, but finalize the invoice in 
and submit the invoice from the Ariba Network - just as a standard invoice. If suppliers create the entire invoice in the buyer’s invoicing site, Ariba Network compliance rules do not 
apply, since the supplier is subject to the invoicing processes and rules configured for the 
buyer’s invoicing solution.
Self billing Ariba Network can automatically transmit self-billing invoices to suppliers and buyers 
based on data in purchase orders, scheduling agreements, and goods receipts using an automated process.

Invoice compliance for contract-based invoices
This feature is only available to buying organizations that use either SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba 
Invoice Management as their invoicing solution. In addition, buyers must configure their invoicing solutions and 
their Ariba Network account to allow suppliers to create compliant contract invoices.
This feature is also available as an optional add-on to buyers using Ariba Invoice Automation. In that case, contract 
agents use the SAP Ariba site to define the contracts, and suppliers punch in to the contract site to retrieve 
information about the contract and add items from the catalog to the invoice, but the invoice is routed directly to 
the buyer’s ERP system.
Invoice Compliance for Contract-based Invoices allows suppliers to create contract-based invoices on the Ariba 
Network:
● Suppliers initiate and finish a contract-based invoice on Ariba Network using an already familiar user interface 
and process.
● Suppliers access the buyer’s invoicing site transparently to retrieve the contract and add items from the 
catalog.
● The appropriate invoice rules are applied when the invoice is submitted to ensure that the final invoice 
complies with the buyer’s invoicing rules. This means errors on invoices are detected before the buyer receives 
the invoice, which facilitates improved electronic invoice and payment processing.
● For countries that require a digital signature, the invoice is digitally signed if the buyer account has been 
enabled for digital signing.

Workflow overview for SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing and 
SAP Ariba Invoice Management
The following describes the workflow between suppliers on Ariba Network and the buyer’s SAP Ariba Buying and 
Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management site:
1. Suppliers initiate the contract-based invoice creation from Ariba Network by selecting the customer for which 
they are creating the contract-based invoice. If the customer has multiple procurement applications, they 
select the business unit address whose contracts they want to access by the Bill To address ID and the contact 
person.
2. Ariba Network automatically transfers the supplier user to the buyer’s SAP Ariba invoicing site, where the 
supplier user selects the contract and enters the invoice number, invoice date, and the Sold To Email (email of 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 19
person who requested the goods or services). Depending on the contract specification, the Sold To Email 
address might be defaulted from the contact person on the contract.
3. The supplier user is then returned to the familiar Create Invoice page to enter additional invoice header 
information.
4. To add items to the invoice, the supplier user is again transferred to the buyer’s SAP Ariba invoicing site to 
select the items from the catalog. If allowed, they can also add non-catalog items.
5. Depending on the contract configuration, the supplier might enter accounting information.
6. The line items are validated against the contract line items, and the contract’s pricing terms are applied. If any 
discrepancies are found, the supplier receives an error message to correct the information.
7. The supplier user is returned to Ariba Network.
8. To make changes to the items on the invoice, the supplier user is transferred back to the buyer’s SAP Ariba 
invoicing site. If allowed, the supplier user can change the unit price on the invoice. This effectively overrides 
the pricing terms defined in the contract for the item. For example, if a catalog level contract is defined with a 
10% discount for all items, and the supplier changes the unit price of an item on the invoice, that price will be 
the final price used on the invoice.
9. On theAriba Network, the supplier user completes the invoice by adding other header fields and adds any 
comments, attachments, tax, shipping or special handling line items either at the invoice header or at the line 
item level.
10. The supplier user can always return to the buyer’s site to retrieve additional items, change a contract header 
fields such as the Sold To Email, or edit or delete existing line items on the invoice. They can also change the 
contract, which effectively deletes the current invoice and starts a new invoice.
11. When the supplier submits the invoice, Ariba Network does a final validation against the buyer’s invoicing rules 
and sends the invoice to SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management.
12. In SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management, the invoice is reconciled and then 
approved for payment if no invoice exceptions are found or all invoice exceptions are resolved.
Workflow overview for Ariba Invoice Automation with SAP 
Ariba Contract Invoicing
1. Suppliers initiate the contract-based invoice creation from Ariba Network by selecting the customer for which 
they are creating the contract-based invoice.
2. Ariba Network transfers the supplier user to the buyer’s SAP Ariba Contract Invoicing site, where the supplier 
user selects the contract, enters the invoice number and invoice date, and specifies the requester (person 
whom the services or goods were sold to). Depending on the contract specification, the requester might be 
defaulted from the contact person on the contract.
3. The supplier user is then returned to the familiar Create Invoice page to enter additional invoice header 
information.
4. The supplier user selects the line items to be invoiced from the catalog. If allowed, they can also add noncatalog items.
5. Depending on the contract configuration, the supplier might enter accounting information.
6. The line items are validated against the contract line items and the contract’s pricing terms are applied. If any 
discrepancies are found, the supplier receives an error message to correct the information.
7. The supplier user is returned to Ariba Network.
8. If allowed, the supplier user can change the unit price on the invoice. This effectively overrides the pricing 
terms defined on the contract for the item. For example, if a catalog level contract is defined with a 10%

discount for all items, and the supplier changes the unit price of an item on the invoice, that price will be the 
final price used on the invoice.
9. On Ariba Network, the supplier user completes the invoice by adding other header fields as well as any 
comments, attachments, tax, shipping, or special handling line items either to the invoice header or on line 
item level.
10. The supplier user can always return to the buyer’s SAP Ariba contract invoicing site to retrieve additional items 
or to edit or delete existing line items on the invoice.
11. When the supplier submits the invoice, Ariba Network does a final validation against the buyer’s invoicing rules. 
If the invoice passes the validation rules, it is digitally signed (if required) and sent as a cXML invoice to the 
buyer’s ERP system.
Self-billing invoices
Ariba Network can automatically transmit self-billing invoices to suppliers and buyers based on data in purchase 
orders, scheduling agreements, and goods receipts using an automated process called Evaluated Receipt 
Settlement (ERS). The buyer creates a self-billing invoice in an external business system and sends it to the 
supplier over Ariba Network.
The ERS/self-billing process supports the following features:
● An agreement is presumed to exist outside Ariba Network between buyer and supplier approving the usage of 
ERS/self-billing.
● The buyer transfers ERS/self-billing data from the ERP system to Ariba Network and makes sure all countryrequired mandatory content is included on self-billing documents.
● If applicable, the Ariba Network adds country-specific signatures to the cXML self-billing document based on 
the supplier’s location (country) and optionally creates a human-readable PDF based on the cXML data.
● A self-billing invoice is labeled “Self-Billing” in the user interface and in the human-readable PDF.
● Ariba Network sends signed self-billing invoices to the buyer’s account.
● Ariba Network sends signed self-billing invoices to the supplier’s account and notifies that supplier.
● Suppliers can download self-billing invoices through their network accounts or optionally configure their 
accounts to receive them through email.
● ERS/self-billing is available for the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
UK, and USA.
● Based on the buyer’s and supplier’s configuration, self-billing documents optionally can be archived using the 
Ariba Network long-term document archiving feature.
Prerequisites
To use this feature, a buyer must have an ERS/self-billing agreement in place with a supplier.

Limitations
Suppliers: This feature is not supported for supplier organizations that have the standard account capability 
enabled.
Workflow for self billing
The following describes the workflow for a self-billing process:
1. The buyer and supplier enter a written agreement on ERS/self-billing.
2. The buyer creates an order with the ERS flag in the buyer's ERP, which sends the order to the supplier on Ariba 
Network.
3. Optionally, the supplier sends an order confirmation to the buyer.
4. Optionally, the supplier sends a ship notice to the buyer.
5. Outside Ariba Network, the supplier ships material or provides services to the buyer.
6. The buyer creates a goods receipt in the ERP.
7. The buyer creates a self-billing invoice in the ERP, which sends it to Ariba Network.
Ariba Network makes the self-billing invoice available to the supplier through the user interface, cXML, and 
PDF.
8. Optionally, the buyer and supplier can archive the self-billing invoice.

General invoice creation compliance features
Invoice dates and date of issue
In some countries, the invoice is considered issued when explicit data-level methods have been applied for integrity 
and authenticity protection, for example, when the invoice is electronically signed. In such cases, receipt of the 
invoice by the buyer is not required to consider the invoice issued. In other countries, the invoice is considered 
issued only when it has become available to the buyer.
In Ariba Network, if digital signatures are applied to meet country-specific requirement, the point of invoice issue is 
the date and time of the invoice after the invoice has passed the business rules and after it has been digitally 
signed. The issue date, which is a timestamp on the document after it has been signed, is the date that matters in 
the parties’ relationship with tax authorities. Upon issue, the invoice may no longer be disposed of or altered and 
both supplier and buyer are responsible for guaranteeing its integrity and authenticity until the end of the storage 
period.
The invoice date is the date that matters in the relationship between the buyer and the supplier. For example, 
payment terms calculations are generally based on the invoice date.
As a best practice, SAP Ariba recommends that suppliers set the current date as the invoice date. Buyers can 
mitigate the risk of a different issue and invoice date by setting the rule Allow invoices to be back-dated the 
specLfied number of days to zero, which means that Ariba Network will reject any invoice with an invoice date 
earlier than the current date. However, this might not be practical depending on the supplier’s backend system 
integration, where any significant delay in transmitting invoices might then mean that entire invoice batches are 
rejected by Ariba Network.
Overdue documents
For documents in the “Pending Queue” that Ariba Network has not been able to post or that were not downloaded 
to the buyer’s invoicing system for more than three days, Ariba Network sends an email notification that lists the 
unacknowledged documents in an email attachment to the buyer. After the buyer has removed those documents 
from the pending queue, they can resend them either manually or automatically. Deleting a document from the 
pending queue does not delete it from Ariba Network, the document remains accessible in the Inbox.
Invoice addresses and validation
For invoice compliance, Ariba Network allows buying organizations to use invoicing rules to specify whether values 
must be provided for the following addresses: Sold To, Bill To, From, Ship To, Ship From, and Remit To.
26 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation
Ariba Network invoices support up to six standard addresses:
● Issued By (the From address)
● Customer (the Sold To address)
● Bill To
● Ship From
● Ship To
● Remit To
The Sold To and the Bill To addresses are usually the same, although Sold To is more important for VAT purposes. 
Buyers can require that Ariba Network validate whether Sold To information on invoices matches Bill To information 
on purchase orders (or Sold To information, if available). This rule applies only to invoices against a single purchase 
order.
Buyers can also use invoicing rules to configure multiple Sold To addresses with address details, optional 
associated VAT ID and/or Sold To Address ID. Buyers can then establish business rules that validate the Sold To on 
a supplier’s invoice against the list of Sold To addresses & VAT IDs. Buyers can specify that only Name, ISO Country, 
and VAT ID are used to validate the Sold To address or that the complete address is used for validation.
Foreign currencies
Ariba Network checks to see if invoice data uses a currency that differs from the currency of the Ship To address. In 
that case, a second currency for tax amounts and for the exchange rate can be stored in the cXML invoice. Only one 
exchange rate is stored per invoice and therefore the same Ship To country must be used on each single invoice.
If Ship To details are provided at line item level, then as a best practice buyers and suppliers are advised to ensure 
that the country of the Ship To addresses and the Sold To address match on the purchase order or invoice.
The cXML invoice supports a currency conversion rate field. For online invoice entry it defaults to the exchange rate 
from a daily Bloomberg feed (the rates are gathered by Bloomberg from multiple pricing sources). The exchange 
rate is used to calculate the tax amounts in the local Ship To currency and is stored as a second value in the cXML 
invoice. As some tax authorities require that the exchange rate is to be retrieved from locally published rates, users 
can update the defaulted exchange rate.
Incoming invoice data (cXML, EDI or CSV) is validated if the tax information is specified in the currency of the Ship 
To information. If the tax information is specified at the invoice header level, and there are multiple Ship To 
countries at line item level, Ariba Network does not validate local tax currencies.
1otLficatLon framework
Ariba Network can send automatic notifications by email when certain events affect the supplier and buyer 
account. Users can use these notifications to monitor activities and debug problems with their account and 
transmitted messages.

Invoice notLficatLons for suppliers (email and Outbox)
● An invoice is undeliverable or its status has been changed.
Invoice rejection reason banner for suppliers
● In the table of invoices in the supplier’s Outbox, the invoice status is shown as Rejected for every rejected 
invoice. When the supplier opens any rejected invoice, a notice appears at the top of the Invoice Detail tab 
summarizing the reason for the rejection. If the invoice was rejected by a buyer’s rule, the notice explains what 
the rule requires. If the buyer rejected the invoice manually, and wrote or chose an explanation for the rejection, 
the message shows the explanation. The supplier might then edit the invoice to comply with the buyer’s rules 
or requests, and might resubmit the invoice.
● If the supplier tries to resubmit a credit memo, a message tells the supplier this is not allowed, and no response 
button appears in the banner.
Invoice notLficatLons for buyers (email and Inbox)
An invoice has arrived or been updated by a supplier.
● Duplicate Invoice: A supplier sent multiple invoices with the same amount and date.
● (Email only) Pending Queue: The buyer has documents in their Inbox that Ariba Network has not been able to 
download to their system for more than three days.
● (via scheduled report) Failed Invoices: the reports contain information about failed or rejected invoices over a 
maximum range of one week. The buyer can generate a report daily, weekly, or for any week specified. The 
report includes the reasons why the invoices failed or were rejected
Invoice history
The History page of an invoice reports the key moments and statuses in the life cycle of the invoice, such as:
● Date the invoice data is received
● Timestamp for when the e-Signature and the From and To details are requested
● Signature timestamp
● Verification timestamp
● Buyer receipt timestamp.
○ cXML Invoice is pushed to the buying organization
○ cXML Invoice is added to the download queue (the buying organization uses a scheduled download)
● Confirmation of successful (or failed) receipt by the buying organization.
● Invoice status feedback (such as information, rejections, approval, payment status).
Each entry in the invoice history contains a comment explaining the action that was performed, an internal process 
and process ID that performed the change, and a timestamp. Depending on the action performed on the invoice, 
28 C O N F I D E N T I A L

the comments field can contain additional status information, for example if the buyer system detected a 
discrepancy between the purchase order and the invoice that led to an invoice exception.
The following shows some examples of information tracked in the invoice history comment field:

Value-added tax (VAT) compliance features
Law reference for exempt trade
In most countries, a law reference and explanation is required for tax exempt trades. For example, in the EU invoices 
for all reverse charge trades need additional statements indicating that the liability for the payment of VAT is 
reversed to the recipients. In Ariba Network, suppliers use the Tax Detail, Description, and Law Reference fields in 
the invoice to capture the explanation and law references.
Support for 0% VAT tax rate
Suppliers who submit invoices in Ariba Network can indicate through the tax invoice entry field Exempt Detail if a 
zero percent VAT rate is zero-rated or exempt. Zero-rated goods or services are taxable, but the tax rate is zero. 
Exempt goods and services are exempt from taxation.
Buyers can control if Exempt Detail is a required or optional invoice field through an invoicing rule. To force 
suppliers to provide a reason for a zero percent VAT tax rate, buyers must enable the rule Require explanation for 
zero-rate VAT.
Fiscal (tax) representatives
When a supplier sells services or manufactured taxable goods in a country where they are neither established nor 
resident, they must appoint a fiscal representative who becomes jointly and severally liable for the supplier. In this 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 29
case, the fiscal representative’s name and address must be included on the invoice. If the fiscal representative pays 
VAT in another EU member state, then their VAT identification number must also be included on the invoice. Ariba 
Network provides standard invoice fields to capture this information.
Non-domestic trade
For non-domestic trade scenarios, all fields required on invoices for trade between two EU countries (intra-EU 
trade) or for trade where at least one non-EU country is involved (cross-border trade) are available and covered by 
standard invoice fields.
In both intra-EU and cross-border trade, buyers may be required to comply with a range of country-specific
requirements. SAP Ariba recommends seeking the advice of a local tax expert when engaging in either of these 
practices.
The requirements for each of these scenarios are generally as follows:
Intra-EU Trade: When products or services are sold from suppliers in one EU country to a buyer in a different EU 
country, the supplier uses a zero-rate VAT on the invoice if the buyer can provide a valid VAT ID. The buyer, in turn, 
must then declare local VAT associated with their acquisition of products or services to the appropriate tax 
authority (reverse charge) and can then reclaim this amount, provided all tax requirements for tax reclaim are met. 
If services are purchased, the supplier is also required to clearly note, on the invoice, that the tax liability is with the 
buyer.
While digital signatures are required for domestic trade, for intra-EU trade the requirements for digital signing are 
more ambiguous. Therefore, SAP Ariba takes a conservative approach and signs based on both countries - the 
From and To country.
Cross-Border Trade: Invoices can also be exchanged for cross border trade of products or services that occur either 
from a supplier in an EU country to a buyer in a non-EU country, or vice versa. From a VAT perspective it is however 
more important to document the cross-border delivery and receiving of goods or services—the invoice builds only 
one part of the documentation. In cases of product trade a customs declaration is required and appropriate taxes 
and customs fees for import/export must be paid.

PDF copy of invoices
Ariba Network provides buyers and suppliers with a PDF copy of invoices, which is a fast and easy method to create 
human readable invoice copies in bulk if requested by a tax authority.
All EU countries and certain other countries require that taxable entities produce records in a human readable form 
for visual inspection to tax authorities within a reasonable time frame. The PDF invoice copy includes all invoice 
details as well as digital signature information. PDF invoice copy is an optional feature that requires enablement 
through SAP Ariba Customer Support.
The PDF rendering includes the text “Copy of Invoice - Not A Tax Invoice” to clarify to tax authorities, buyers, and 
suppliers that the cXML invoice remains the legal document.
The Ariba Network generates the PDF invoice copy in the language of the supplier's locale (which is the preferred 
language configured for the account administrator). The following languages are supported:
● Brazilian Portuguese
● Danish
● Dutch
● English
● French
● German
● Greek
● Hungarian
● Italian
● Japanese
● Korean
● Norwegian
● Polish
● Romanian
● Russian
● Simplified Chinese
● Spanish
● Swedish
● Traditional Chinese
● Turkish
 Note
If the supplier's locale is not supported for PDF invoice creation, Ariba Network creates the PDF invoice copy in 
English.
Suppliers can also create a PDF version of a submitted invoice in the Ariba Network. For more information, see 
Invoice PDF generation for suppliers [page 34].
PDF invoice copy availability
PDF invoice copies are available to suppliers and buyers as follows:
For suppliers
If enabled for PDF invoice copy, suppliers can access a PDF invoice copy through the archival process as part of the

● Buyers can generate and access PDF invoice copies through the archival process as part of the archive invoice 
zip file. This option is available to all buyers regardless of their installed invoicing solution.
● PDF invoice copy attachment is supported using the following Ariba invoicing solutions:
○ Ariba Invoice Automation
○ SAP Ariba Invoice Management
○ SAP Ariba Contract Invoicing
 Note
With SAP Ariba Invoice Management and SAP Ariba Contract Invoicing, an attachment to the outbound 
invoice reconciliation document includes a copy of the cXML tax invoice, PDF invoice copy of the cXML tax 
invoice, all supplier-provided invoice attachments, and the country-specific XML invoice (for invoices for 
Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia). By default, invoice reconciliation documents don't include attachments, but 
customers can enable this functionality through SAP Ariba Customer Support.
● PDF invoice copy attachment is supported using the Ariba Network adapter for SAP NetWeaver or the Ariba 
Network adapter for Oracle Fusion Middleware.
● With customization, PDF invoice copy attachments can also be utilized by Ariba Invoice on premise customers 
and Ariba Invoice Automation customers using a custom adapter.
Invoice copy PDF creation
If an Ariba Network buyer account has been enabled to generate PDF invoice copies, PDF invoice copies are 
generated for the following supplier-submitted invoice types:
● Invoices submitted through EDI or cXML that are not self-signed by the supplier
● Manually created PO-based or non-PO invoices
● Invoices created through CSV import
PDF copies of invoices are not generated for the following invoices:
● Invoice Conversion Services (ICS) invoices
● Supplier self-signed invoices
For these invoices, the provider or supplier is expected to include a PDF invoice copy as an invoice attachment if 
required.
In the archive invoice zip file, the file name for the invoice copy PDF file is concatenated from the following 
information:
● Invoice or credit memo date
● Account ANID
● Invoice or credit memo number
● Invoice type
● “From” and “To” countries (if the credit memo or invoice has been digitally signed)
Example: 2012_08_20_AN12345678910_INV_IN5689774-v1_eSigned_FromDE_ToFR.pdf
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 33
If PDF invoice copies are attached to invoices, a random file name is created for the PDF invoice copy attachment.
Generating and sending digitally signed custom PDF invoice 
documents to buyers
In several countries, suppliers are required to send digitally signed invoices. Based on the requirements, SAP Ariba 
buyer administrators can configure Ariba Network to receive either the digitally signed copies of the standard 
template invoices or custom PDF invoices. Once the configuration is done, after a supplier creates an invoice, Ariba 
Network automatically generates digitally signed PDF invoices in custom format.
Suppliers can also open and view the digitally signed custom PDF invoices, and if required, save them on their 
computers. The digitally signed custom invoice also contains an appendix section which lists out all the additional 
details of each line item.
Invoice PDF generation for suppliers
The invoice PDF generation feature enables suppliers to create a PDF version of a submitted invoice on the Ariba 
Network.
A PDF can be created for any type of invoice or credit memo. All fields visible on the user interface are included in 
the PDF, including fields added by buyer customization or country-based customizations. The Download PDF 
option is available in the header and footer of the invoice details page when an invoice is submitted.
The following information is added to the PDF footer automatically:
● Username and last name of the PDF creator
● Date and time when the PDF was created, including the supplier location time zone
 Note
The following terms are included on the invoice and credit memo PDFs when these documents are generated 
by suppliers based in South Africa:
● Standard Invoice / Tax Invoice
● Credit Memo / Tax Invoice
Prerequisites
To see the Download PDF option, the print option must be enabled.

How to generate a PDF
You can create an invoice PDF and view it on Ariba Network or you can save it.
Procedure
1. Log into your Ariba Network supplier account.
2. Select Outbox on the supplier Home dashboard.
3. Select the invoice for which you want to create a PDF.
4. Click the Download PDF link on the header or footer of the Invoice Details page.
5. Do one of the following:
○ To view the invoice PDF, click Open.
○ To download the invoice PDF directly to your downloads folder, click Save.
○ To download the invoice PDF to a location of your choice, click Save As.
When you save a PDF, a file name is generated automatically for the PDF file, using the following format: 
“invoice number.pdf”.
PDF invoice copy attachment to invoices
In buyer accounts enabled for PDF invoice copy attachments to invoices, a PDF copy of the invoice data is 
automatically added as a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) attachment to the invoice cXML as follows:
<InvoiceDetailRequestHeader>
<Extrinsic name="invoicePDF"><Attachment> <URL>cid:18040725.1344960046396@cxml.org</
URL></Attachment></Extrinsic> 
</InvoiceDetailRequestHeader>
Invoice archival options and delivery
Ariba Network can save invoices in zip format (twice a day, daily, every week, every two weeks, or every month) and 
store them for three months. For each specified invoice archival period, Ariba Network waits for a 30-day period 
before it begins the archival process unless you want to archive invoices immediately. The 30 day lag time for 
archiving reflects the average time it takes for an invoice to complete the invoicing cycle.
For example: Using the Weekly option, the beginning date for the invoice archival is the date that you start 
archiving. If you start archiving on December 12, then the end date of the weekly invoice archival period is 
December 18. After seven days (December 19), Ariba Network waits for a 30 day period to January 18 and then 
archives the invoices that were created between December 12 through 18.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 35
Archived invoices are available for download from the Archived Invoices page in the Outbox for suppliers and the 
Inbox for buyers. Ariba Network can also send archived invoice files to the pending queue or automatically deliver 
them (via HTTPS) as soon as they are available.
Automatic delivery
Regardless of whether your organization chooses to utilize the HTTPS option for automatic delivery, archive invoice 
files continue to be stored for up to three months in the buyer’s Inbox or supplier’s Outbox.
The URL for the archived zip file can be any URL where you want Ariba Network to automatically deliver the 
archived zip files. You can specify a URL with an https prefix so that communication is encrypted. Ariba Network 
uses the HTTPS post method to post the archived zip files to the location specified in the URL. You can 
authenticate an HTTPS post request based on the client certificate available for Ariba Network. For a list of Ariba 
Network’s trusted certificate authorities, see the Ariba Network cXML solutions guide.
Ariba Network provides information about automatic delivery attempts in the Delivery Status and Delivery Date 
columns on the Archive Invoices page. If a delivery attempt of an archive fails, then Ariba Network sends an email 
notification explaining the failure. As an alternative, users can check the status in the Delivery Failure Reason 
column of the Archive Invoices page.
Archive zip file contents
The archived invoice zip files created by Ariba Network contain one or more of the following types of information:
● Raw invoice data in cXML format. (Ariba Network invoices are structured based on the cXML Invoices 
Document Type Definitions).
● A human-readable copy and invoice in PDF format (an optional feature that requires enablement through SAP 
Ariba Customer Support).
● A log file that indicates key dates for invoice processing by Ariba Network, including signing and verificationrelated events, start of processing at the receiver side, and approval and payment status.
● Any related attachment files.
● An empty file with the naming convention "<AN ID of the customer>.anid". This file is used by archive 
providers to determine the partition in their document management system / e-Archive for loading the archive 
file.
● An empty file with the naming convention "<invoice file name>_<STATUS>.txt", where <STATUS> 
shows the status of the invoice at the time of the archival.
The zip file uses the same filename structure as the history file, status file, and attachments. These meta attributes 
allow easy retrieval of archived invoices and provide the following data:
● Invoice or credit memo date
● Buyer ANID / Supplier ANID (for the supplier download)
● Invoice or credit memo number
● CC’ed or invoice conversion (copied invoices)
● “From” and “To” countries (if the credit memo or invoice has been digitally signed)
Under regulations detailed at the country level, all invoices issued and received by enterprises or service providers 
acting in their name and on their behalf must be archived for a defined number of years at the end of the calendar 
36 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation
year in which the invoice was issued. This archive period also applies to all electronic signatures, certificates, and 
verification protocols.
The general requirement for an archive is to ensure that invoice data cannot be altered or removed. You can achieve 
this requirement by using special storage media (such as WORM technology = Write Once, Read Many) and 
applying a digital signature, which guarantees integrity (a proof that a document is unchanged) in combination with 
secure access rights to the storage location.
 Note
The certificate used for the digital signature might expire during the archiving period. This is not critical as the 
certificate only needs to be valid at signing, transmission, and receiving time. After the invoice has been 
archived, the certificate can expire because the validity of the certificate at the time of issue remains verifiable
through the stored verification protocol. The integrity can always be confirmed through a cryptographic 
verification of the signature regardless of the validity of the certificate at the time of audit.
Download archived invoices from the pending queue
You can choose to automatically send archived invoice files to the pending queue, facilitating secure download.
If archived invoice files are sent to the pending queue, you can download them over an HTTPS connection from 
your external ERP system to the Ariba Network using a GetPendingRequest and DataRequest pair.
Only one archived invoice file can be downloaded per GetPendingRequest and DataRequest pair. When using a 
GetPendingRequest to query for archived invoice files in the pending queue, you must set the maxMessages 
value to 1 to prevent failure in the case of excessive attachment sizes. If you choose to send archived invoices to the 
pending queue, you cannot also have archived invoice files automatically delivered via HTTPS.
Example GetPendingRequest for archived invoice files
<GetPendingRequest lastReceivedTimestamp="2015-02-13T16:00:00-08:00" 
maxMessages="1">
 <MessageType>InvoiceArchive</MessageType>
</GetPendingRequest>
For additional information about archived invoices and the pending queue, see the Ariba Network buyer 
administration guide.

Long term archiving of tax invoices
Long term archiving of tax invoices refer to electronic archiving of invoices for longer periods of time based on 
country-specific archiving policies and tax auditing procedures.
Each country has a defined retention time for archived invoices. Most countries issuing tax-compliant electronic 
invoices collaborate with third party archive providers to retain their invoices for longer periods of time. Archive 
providers are required to store and retain the archived invoices for the time specified by the tax authority of their 
respective countries.
Ariba Network offers a long term archiving solution for tax invoices. Buyers and suppliers in countries that do not 
have their own archiving process can leverage Ariba Network’s electronic archiving process to archive their tax 
invoices. Ariba Network partners with third party archive providers to facilitate electronic archiving of tax invoices

and allow tax authorities to access, monitor, and retrieve the archived documents during a tax audit. In addition, 
users can download the archived tax invoices from the Document Archive page on Ariba Network.
To leverage SAP Ariba's invoice archiving process during tax auditing, Ariba Network provides the Tax Auditor role. 
An auditor or a user with Tax Auditor role can view, access, and search invoices during a tax audit. The Download 
Archive Document link on the Invoice Details page allows the user to download archived invoices directly from the 
archive provider's portal. Suppliers and buyers can configure their account for long term invoice archiving. After the 
configuration, Ariba Network automatically archives the latest invoices and users can manually archive the older 
invoices.
On the Ariba Network Home page, the tab named Document Archive is visible to both suppliers and buyers only if 
their accounts are enabled for long term document archiving. The Document Archive page contains the following 
pages:
● Archived Documents
● Download Status
The Archived Documents page displays the details of the documents archived in the Document List table on the 
Ariba Network user interface. The Request Download button allows users to download archived invoices.
The following fields in the Search Filters pane allows buyers to filter the archived documents search criteria:
● Expiration Date Range
● Archive Status
The Download Status page contains information about the archived documents download status.
On the Invoice Details page the link named Download Archive Document allows users to download archived 
documents directly from the service provider's portal.
The following describes the end to end steps to view, search, access, and download archived invoices on Ariba 
Network:
1. Suppliers and buyers enable their account for long-term document archiving.
2. The Document Archive tab appears on the Home dashboard.
3. Account Administrator enables Archive Access permission to the relevant users.
 Note
Archive Access permission allows suppliers and buyers to access and download the archived tax invoices 
on Ariba Network.
4. Supplier or buyer user clicks the Document Archive tab to view the archived tax invoices.

9. The buyer completes the relevant enablement tasks in order to allow the supplier to transact in production.
10. Once the supplier successfully completes testing, they switch to the production account.
11. The supplier is now ready to upload, or email actual PDF invoices to the system.
Workflow for the PDF invoice processing
The following diagram illustrates the PDF invoice processing workflow:
Figure 7: Workflow for uploading PDF invoices to Ariba Network
The following steps describe the workflow process of a supplier who uploads a PDF invoice from their accounting 
system to Ariba Network:
1. The supplier generates a PDF invoice from their accounting system.
2. The supplier uploads the PDF invoice to Ariba Network. Prior to the upload, the supplier is prompted to choose 
a buyer.
3. The service provider processes the PDF and posts the invoice cXML to Ariba Network. During the process the 
document is listed on the PDF Conversions page in Ariba Network with the status Conversion Pending. When 
the conversion is completed successfully, the result can be seen on the PDF Conversions page with the status 
Converted.
If errors occur during the conversion process, the supplier sees the status Conversion Failed on the History tab 
of the PDF Document Details page. Also, if the setting Send a notLficatLon when PDF invoices are 
undeliverable or rejected is enabled, Ariba Network sends an email to the supplier stating the reason for the 
failure.

Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation
4. The supplier may choose to review conversion results before submission (which is recommended), or to 
automatically submit the converted PDF invoices to Ariba Network.
5. If the supplier wants to review the conversion results before submission, Ariba Network generates a draft 
invoice, which is visible in the Drafts tab of the supplier’s Outbox. The original PDF invoice from the supplier is 
included as an attachment in the generated draft invoice. The supplier must review the draft invoice within 
seven days, edit it to correct any errors, and submit the invoice. Otherwise the status of the draft invoice is set 
to Failed. This review is done on the Drafts tab of the supplier’s Outbox.
6. When the supplier chooses to submit the extraction result without manual validation, the cXML invoice is 
created and the supplier can view the invoice status on the Invoices tab of the supplier’s Outbox, or if they 
have subscribed to receive email notifications, they receive an email notification of the invoice status. After 
successful validation, the invoice status is updated to Sent on the Invoices tab of the supplier’s Outbox.
If errors occur during the automatic submission process, then the invoice appears with the status Failed on the 
Invoices tab. The supplier can edit the invoice in order to comply with the validation rules and resubmit it. The 
record of the previous failed invoice remains in the system with the status Obsoleted.
7. From this point, invoice processing converges with the standard Ariba Network process:
1. The cXML is digitally signed (depending on the originating and destination countries).

Figure 8: Email PDF invoice processing workflow
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice creation C O N F I D E N T I A L 49
The following steps describe the email PDF invoice processing workflow:
1. The supplier generates a PDF invoice.
2. The supplier sends an email to Ariba Network (using the following email address: pdfinvoiceprod#ansmtp.ariba.com) containing invoice data in PDF format.
1. If the email can be processed, the process continues at step 3.
2. If the email cannot be processed, the system sends a rejection notification message to the email provided 
in Finalize feature settings NotLficatLons PDF Invoice Failure .
All rejection notifications are logged on the Outbox PDF Conversions page, except for the case 
when Ariba Network is unable to identify the supplier, and a reply is sent back to the originating email 
address.
3. A third-party service provider converts the PDF to cXML. From this point, the process converges with the 
standard PDF invoice processing. For more information, see PDF invoice processing.

About Ariba Network invoice rules
The Ariba Network invoice rules control that suppliers submit invoices that meet the buyer’s requirement for 
invoice content. Some rules can be set to require suppliers to provide certain information, other rules control if a 
supplier is granted a choice to include certain information or not.
Ariba Network evaluates these rules against online, cXML, or EDI invoices from suppliers. It rejects invoices that fail 
validation, so buyers receive only invoices that are compatible with their procurement system configuration.
Buyers can configure rules in the Invoice Rules section of the Default Transaction Rules page in their Ariba 
Network account ( Administration ConfiJuratLon Default Transaction Rules ). However, they can override 
them for specific suppliers and supplier groups or the country from where the invoice is sent.
Suppliers can review the rules that have been specified by the buyer for invoice transactions in the Customer 
Details page of their Ariba Network account (Customer Relationships > Customer Details).
Invoice rule levels
Ariba Network categorizes invoice rules into the following levels:
● Default Transaction Rules
These rules are available in the Default Transaction Rules page.
● Supplier Group Rule Level
These rules are supplier-group specific rules that are enabled in the Supplier Group Transaction Rules page. 
Supplier group rules are a subset of the rules available at the default transaction rule level and they override the 
invoice rules specified on the Default Transaction Rules page. However, the way in which Ariba Network 
applies the rules is different when the supplier belongs to a supplier group and the buyer has enabled countrybased invoice rules for the supplier’s country.
● Country-based Invoice Rule Level
The country-based invoice rules are a subset of the default transaction rules and supplier group rules. Buyers 
can define country-based invoice rules for any country.
SAP Ariba provides a set of invoice rules that have predefined settings in the form of templates for a list of 
countries. These templates reflect SAP Ariba’s current knowledge of invoice requirements for those countries. 
54 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
Buyers can use these templates as a starting point to configure their country-based invoice rules, since the 
country-based default settings may not be appropriate for every organization. SAP Ariba strongly recommends 
that buyers consult their tax and/or legal advisors to determine the applicability of any business rule 
implementation.
ICS invoice rules
For buyers that subscribe to SAP Ariba invoice conversion services (ICS), SAP Ariba provides a separate set of 
invoice rules for invoices sent from an ICS provider. For information about ICS invoice rules, see the Ariba Network 
guide to invoice conversion.
Invoice rule types
Rules are categorized into the following rule types:
● Allow Rules. When these rules are checked, suppliers have the option to enter values per rule setting or not. If 
these rules are not checked, the rule behavior is enforced.
For example, enabling the PO-based invoice rule Allow suppliers to change the unit price makes the unit price 
an editable field. If the rule is not checked, then suppliers cannot modify the unit price when creating an invoice 
online, and the unit price of the invoice is validated against the purchase order unit price when submitting a 
cXML or EDI invoice.
● Require Rules. When these rules are checked, the buyer mandates that the supplier provides certain 
information on the invoice. When these rules are not checked, suppliers have the option to leave that 
information blank.
For example, enabling the rule Require suppliers to provide a reason for each credit memo requires that 
suppliers enter a reason when submitting a credit memo. If the rule is not checked, suppliers can still enter a 
reason for a credit memo, but the invoice is not rejected if they don’t.
● Other Rules
The following are other rules that don’t start with Allow or Require, but that are processed as Require rules:
○ Enforce strict address validation for required address fields
○ Display text boxes for buyer and supplier VAT IDs in invoice headers
○ Display invoice totals as Subtotal, Tax Amount, and Amount Due
○ Copy Bill To address on purchase orders to Sold To address on invoices
Invoice rule application
Ariba Network applies rules that are available for configuration at the default transaction rule level, the supplier 
group rule level, and the country-based rule level.
Generally, supplier group rules override default transaction rules, and the country-based rules are evaluated either 
against the default transaction rules or supplier group rules (if defined) to determine how to enforce a rule based 
on the rule type (Require or Allow rule).
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 55
Evaluation of default transaction rules
A default transaction level rule is applied if any of the following conditions are met:
● The rule only exists at the default transaction rule level.
● Country-based invoice rules are not enabled or not activated for the invoice country of origin and the supplier 
does not belong to a supplier group.
● Country-based invoice rules are not enabled or not activated for the invoice country of origin and the supplier 
belongs to a supplier group that is configured to use the default transaction rules.
● Country-based invoice rules are defined and activated for the invoice country of origin but the supplier belongs 
to a supplier group that is configured to use the default transaction rules and the buyer has not enabled 
country-based rules (the rule Ignore country-based invoice rules is checked at the default transaction rule 
level).
Evaluation of supplier group rules
A supplier group level rule is applied if any of the following conditions are met:
● Country-based invoice rules are defined or are active for the originating country of the invoice, however the 
buyer has not enabled country-based rules for the supplier group to which the supplier belongs.
● Country-based invoice rules are enabled for the supplier group and the supplier belongs to that supplier group, 
but there are no rules defined for the originating country of the invoice or the buyer has not activated the rules 
for that country.
● The rule exists at the supplier group level, but not at the country rule level and the supplier belongs to that 
supplier group.
Evaluation of country-based invoice rules
Country-based invoice rules are always evaluated together with either the default transaction rules (if no supplier 
group rules apply) or supplier group rules (if the supplier for which the invoice is evaluated belongs to a supplier 
group).
There is no hierarchy to invoice rules. A country-based rule does not override a supplier group rule or a default rule. 
Buyers must set the rules as shown in the following tables for the rules to be applied. Generally, if a Require rule is 
checked at any level, the rule is enforced. For an Allow rule to take effect, it must be allowed on both levels.
Allow rule evaluation
Allow rules must be checked at both the supplier group level or default transaction level and the country rule level 
for a supplier to be allowed to perform a certain action.

default transaction rule Country-based rule Rule applied in invoice

reason for each credit memo
No Yes Yes

Country-based invoice rules
Country-based invoice rules allow buyers to ensure that invoices meet certain country requirements and at the 
same time group suppliers based on business-related criteria. For example, a buyer that allows some suppliers to 
send non-PO invoices can now still group them into a supplier group, and in addition define country-specific invoice 
rules that enforce certain rules based on the originating country identified for the invoice.
Buyers are responsible for editing and then activating country-based invoice rules. The country-based invoice rules 
apply to invoices created once the rules have been activated for that country. SAP Ariba recommends that buyers 
discuss these rules with their suppliers to avoid unnecessary invoice rejections due to invoice rule enforcement.
Some country-based invoice rules can be configured by suppliers. For more information, see Country-based invoice 
rules configurable by suppliers [page 61].
SAP Ariba maintains default country-based invoice rules for the countries based on research with our tax advisors 
and field experience. Although recommended, the default settings for the country-based invoice rules may not be 
appropriate for your organization. Consult your tax and/or legal advisors to determine how to configure your 
invoice rules.

Originating country of an invoice
Ariba Network uses the originating country on the invoice to check if active country-based rules exists and must be 
applied. Ariba Network determines the originating country by first checking the prefix of the supplier’s VAT ID. If 
this is not available, Ariba Network uses the supplier’s address on the invoice.
To determine the originating country, Ariba Network checks the invoice for the following information in the order 
given below:.
Order Originating Country Determined by…
1 Tax representative’s VAT ID prefix
2 Tax representative’s country code
3 Supplier’s VAT ID prefix
4 ‘From’ address’s country code
Document label based on originating country
Ariba Network will determine the label on invoices and credit memos based on the originating country of the 
invoice/credit memo. This means that Ariba Network now consistently applies the same validation logic to 
determine if country-specific requirements exist based on the ‘From’ country on the invoice.

Invoice rules
Country-based invoice rules for blanket purchase orders
Buyers can configure blanket purchase order (BPO) invoice rules at the default transaction, supplier group, or 
country rule level. If blanket purchase order (BPO) invoice rules are configured either at the supplier group/default 
transaction rule level but not at the country-based rule level or at the country-based rule level and not at the 
supplier group/default transaction rule level, Ariba Network applies the blanket purchase order invoice rules as 
follows:
● If BPO-specific invoice rules are enabled at the country-based rule level only (that is, Enable BPO-specLfic
invoice rules is set to No at the default transaction or supplier group level), and if the supplier belongs to the 
supplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule process using the values available in the PO 
and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at the supplier group level to BPO invoices originating from that 
country.
If the supplier does not belong to the supplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule 
process to BPO invoices originating from that country using the PO and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at 
the default transaction values level.
● If BPO-specific invoice rules are enabled at the default transaction or supplier group level only (Enable BPOspecLfic invoice rules is set to No at the country-based rule level), and if the supplier belongs to the supplier 
group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule process using the values in the PO and Non-PO 
Invoice Field Rules section at the country-based rule level to BPO invoices originating from that country.
If the supplier does not belong to the supplier group, then Ariba Network applies the Require/Allow rule 
process to BPO invoices originating from that country using the PO and Non-PO Invoice Field Rules section at 
the country-based rule values.
Country-based invoice rule to restrict partial credit
Ariba Network buyers in the United States and Australia can enable a country-based invoice rule to restrict partial 
credit for invoices.
The following rule appears in the General Invoice Rules section:
● Require suppliers to credit the full invoice amount on line-item credit memos—This rule is available only 
when the Allow suppliers to send line-item credit memo rule is checked. When this rule is checked, it requires 
suppliers to credit the full invoice amount when they send a line-item credit memo. Suppliers can use a credit 
memo to reverse an invoice’s charges, but they can’t credit only part of the invoice line item. This rule applies to 
line-item credit memos created against material invoices and service invoices.
 Note
When this rule is checked:
○ Price Adjustment rules for credit memos and debit memos are both automatically unchecked.
The following invoice rules also affect line-item credit memos:
○ Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments—If this rule is checked, then suppliers can add the 
Attachment section to the header of a line-item credit memo, and they can attach files.
○ Require invoice Sold To Name and Country to match PO Bill To Name and Country (or Sold To 
information if available)—If this rule is checked, a line-item credit memo displays a warning if the Sold 
To information doesn’t match the Bill To information from the order.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 59
○ Require your company's VAT ID for domestic trade—If this rule is checked, the Customer VAT field is 
required.
The following invoice rules are ignored for line-item credit memos:
○ Require suppliers to provide tax information in invoice headers or line items
○ Require VAT
○ Require your company's VAT ID only for intra-EU trade
Country-based invoice rule for automatic invoice creation 
from receipts
Ariba Network buyers in the United States, Australia, and South Africa can enable a country-based invoice rule to 
automatically create invoices from receipts.
The following country-based invoice rule allows the Ariba Network buyers in the United States, Australia, and South 
Africa to invoice automatically when the buyer sends a receipt for received quantities:
● Enable automatic invoice creation from receipts
This rule is effective only when the default transaction rule Require suppliers to include only received quantities 
on invoices is checked. The Enable automatic invoice creation from receipts rule causes the Ariba Network to 
automatically create an invoice when the buyer sends a receipt for material goods. The rule ensures that invoices 
are based on goods that the buyer has received. This rule makes the invoicing process more efficient, and it 
reduces the possibility of invoices not matching goods receipts. For suppliers, the rule automates invoice creation 
for material goods and it reduces the possibility of invoices being rejected for not matching goods receipts.
To automatically generate invoices based on receipts sent from a buyer, the supplier must agree to automatic 
invoicing by completing the Automatic Invoice Creation Acceptance page for each buyer that has enabled the 
country-based rule.
Source of data for automatically-generated invoices
When the Ariba Network generates an invoice automatically based on a receipt submitted by the buyer, it gathers 
information for the invoice from the purchase order, the receipt, and the supplier's company profile. Header-level 
information for the invoice comes from the purchase order. If the tax information is not present on the order, the 
VAT information is obtained from the supplier's company profile.
Item-level information for the invoice comes from the purchase order with the exception of the following two fields,
which come from the receipt:
● Order Line Number
● Quantity
60 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
Taxes
All taxes for invoices generated automatically from receipts must come from the purchase order. Taxes can be 
specified at the header-level of the purchase order or at the line-item level, but not in both places. To ensure that 
line item level taxes for standard invoices are copied from the purchase order, the buyer must enable the following 
default transaction rule: Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice.
 Note
The Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice rule does not copy header-level taxes from the 
purchase order, and it does not apply to line item credit memos. For line item credit memos, taxes at line item 
level default from the invoice and not from the purchase order.
Allowances and Charges
Allowances and charges for invoices generated automatically from receipts must come from the purchase order. 
Allowances and charges can be specified at the header-level of the purchase order and at the line-item level. Like 
taxes, all allowances and charges should be specified as a percentage rate on the purchase order. The percentage 
is applied to all invoices generated for the order.
 Note
If an allowance or charge is specified as a flat amount on the purchase order, it is applied to every invoice 
generated from a receipt, which could result in cumulatively higher allowances or charges than the customer 
intended.
For more information about creating automatic invoices from receipts, see Creating and managing invoices, credit 
memos, and debit memos.
Country-based invoice rules confiJurable by 
suppliers
This optional Ariba Network feature is available to all public suppliers.
This feature allows Ariba Network suppliers to configure their own country-based invoice rules for any country.
Suppliers can configure more than 20 rules for any country or region from where their invoices may originate. The 
rules are a subset of the country-based invoice rules that are available to buyers. If a supplier would choose to 
define their own country-based invoice rules, an invoice from the supplier must pass those rules before it is 
validated against any invoice rules configured by their buyers.
SAP Ariba offers invoice rules that have predefined settings in the form of templates for the countries and regions 
in the table below. The default settings for the country-specific invoice rules may not be appropriate for the 
supplier’s organization. Suppliers must consult their tax and/or legal advisors to determine the applicability of any 
business rule they choose to implement and adjust the settings accordingly.

Any invoices from a supplier, which do not pass the country-based invoice rules defined by that supplier, are 
rejected and are not created on Ariba Network.
Ariba Network uses the originating country or region on the invoice to check if active country-based rules exist and 
must be applied.
To determine the originating country or region, Ariba Network checks the invoice for the following information in 
the order given below:
Order Originating country determined by…
1 Tax representative’s VAT ID prefix
2 Tax representative’s country
3 Supplier’s VAT ID prefix
4 ‘Sold From’ address’ country
The Ariba Network administrator with the supplier may reach out to SAP Ariba Support and request to have their 
country-based invoice rules functionality locked/unlocked.
When a supplier has locked their country-based invoice rules functionality, no countries or regions can be added or 
removed – and no settings can be changed for countries or regions that the supplier has defined rules for. When 
the configuration is locked, the validations will still be applied for all activated country or region configurations.

General invoice rules
The following rules are located under General Rules in the Invoice Rules section:
● Allow suppliers to send invoices to this account.
This rule enables suppliers to send invoices to the buyer’s account.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Default template rule is set to allow for all countries, but buyers might 
want to uncheck this rule until their systems are fully configured for each country to process invoices from 
them.
● Allow suppliers to send invoices with service information.
Allows suppliers to submit invoices with detailed general or labor service items (with InvoiceDetailServiceItem 
elements). Ariba Network displays a new section on the Generate Invoice page for suppliers, which enables 
them to enter detailed service-related information. This rule does not apply to invoices based on service 
sheets, which suppliers can submit for any purchase orders with service lines that require service sheets.
● Allow users to view invoices on Ariba Network from your application.
Allows users in the buyer’s organization to view invoices submitted from Ariba Network from the buyer’s ERP 
system. Important: This rule is available only after your account has been configured to use SAP Ariba’s 
SiteMinder SSO Authentication. Contact your SAP Ariba Customer Support representative for assistance.
● Allow suppliers to send non-PO invoices / Allow suppliers to send invoices with a contract reference
These rules control the invoicing options for invoices that do not refer to purchase orders routed through the 
Ariba Network. Depending on how you set these rules, you can control the type of invoice you allow. For 
example, if you only accept contract invoices, do not allow suppliers to submit non-PO invoices, but allow them 
to submit contract invoices. The following table describes the behavior of these rules:

● Allow suppliers to send invoices if a PCard or credit card was included in the order.
Allows suppliers to submit invoices against purchase orders that list a PCard or credit card.
● Allow suppliers to send header credit memos and debit memos.
Allows suppliers to submit header-level credit and debit memos. Suppliers can create two types of credit 
memos: header-level or line-item. To allow suppliers to create header-level credit memos, click this check box.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Disallow for all countries or regions except the US, Canada, and ‘Hong 
Kong, China’ (default).
● Allow suppliers to send line-item credit memo
Allows suppliers to create line-item credit memos for quantity or price adjustments.
○ Quantity Adjustment—Allows suppliers to send line-item credit memos to make quantity adjustments at 
the line level.
○ Price Adjustment—Allows suppliers to send line-item credit memos to make price adjustments at the line 
level. This includes changes to taxes, shipping, and special handling charges.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Quantity adjustment allowed for all countries (default). Price adjustment 
not allowed for all countries (default).
● Allow suppliers to create line-item credit memo without reference to an existing invoice in Ariba Network.
Allows suppliers to enter any external reference (outside of Ariba Network) in the DocumentReference cXML 
element.
● Allow suppliers to create line-item credit memo that exceeds the invoice amount
○ If enabled, allows suppliers to create a line-item credit memo with an amount that is more than the 
invoiced amount.
○ If disabled, does not allow suppliers to create a line-item credit memo with an amount that is more than 
the invoiced amount.
● Allow suppliers to send line-item debit memo
Allows suppliers to create line-item debit memos for price adjustments.
68 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
○ Price Adjustment—Allows suppliers to send line-item debit memos to make price adjustments at the line 
level. This includes changes to taxes, shipping, and special handling charges.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Price adjustment not allowed for all countries (default).
● Allow suppliers to create line-item debit memo without reference to an existing invoice in Ariba Network.
Allows suppliers to enter any external reference (outside of Ariba Network) in the DocumentReference cXML 
element.
● Require suppliers to provide a reason for each credit memo.
Suppliers must enter a comment for each credit memo.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Require for all countries (default).
● Require line-item credit memo to reference another invoice
You can require suppliers to reference another invoice while creating a line-item credit memo.
This rule is available only after the rule Allow suppliers to send line-item credit memo is checked.
When the rule is checked, the line-item credit memo must contain a reference to another invoice using the 
DocumentReference cXML element.
 Note
This rule only applies to invoices sent through cXML.
● Allow suppliers to cancel invoices they create.
If suppliers make mistakes on invoices, they might want to cancel them. If suppliers are allowed to reuse 
invoice numbers, they can correct invoices and resubmit them using the original numbers.
Country or Region Based Invoice Rule Setting: Allow for the US, ‘Hong Kong, China’, Austria, Belgium, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, 
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK (default).
● Require suppliers to create an order confirmatLon for the PO before creating an invoice.
This rule requires suppliers to create an order confirmation against the purchase order before they can submit 
an invoice. This rule does not prevent a supplier from invoicing a partially confirmed order.
For suppliers that submit invoices through cXML or EDI, if the supplier submits an invoice without first creating 
an order confirmation, Ariba Network rejects the invoice and the supplier receives an email notification that 
specifies why the invoice was rejected. The supplier can also log on to http://supplier.ariba.com and view the 
error message on the order history page.
Suppliers cannot confirm service purchase orders (purchase orders with at least one line that requires a 
service sheet) with any hidden amounts, and will therefore be unable to invoice those orders if this rule is 
checked.
For suppliers that submit invoices online, the invoice button will be disabled if the order has not been 
confirmed. By moving the mouse over the disabled invoice button, the supplier can view the reason why they 
are not allowed to submit the invoice.
● Require suppliers to create invoice with line item quantity greater than zero.
This rule requires suppliers to create invoices with material line item quantities greater than zero. This rule is 
ignored for service items.
This rule can be configured for all suppliers or specific supplier groups.
● Require suppliers to create invoice with line item price greater than zero.
This rule requires suppliers to create invoices with material line item prices greater than zero. This rule is 
ignored for service items.
This rule can be configured for all suppliers or specific supplier groups.
● Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments.
Allows suppliers to attach files to invoices to give more explanation or supporting information. For example, a 
supplier might attach proof of delivery or terms and conditions. Attachments can be in any format, such as 
Word documents, fax images, or Excel spreadsheets.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 69
Ariba Network stores attachments online, and displays them in the online Outbox. Attachments expire 18 
months after Ariba Network receives them. After 18 months, they are no longer available online.
By default, attachments are limited to 10MB, but customers can request SAP Ariba Customer Support to 
increase that limit up to 100MB.
If this rule is checked, the rule Your procurement application can download invoice attachments (MIME 
multipart messages) is displayed. If the buyer’s procurement application does not support downloading of 
invoice attachments, then buyers can check the rule Send URLs to view attachments on Ariba Network.
 Note
Buyer accounts can be enabled to generate PDF invoice copies and attach them to each invoice. To use this 
feature, the ERP system must support downloading of MIME attachments. The invoicing rule Allow 
suppliers to send invoice attachments does not impact the PDF invoice copy attachment generation, and 
therefore the option to send URLs to view attachments on Ariba Network is only available for attachments 
added by the supplier.
● Require suppliers to send invoice attachments.
This rule requires suppliers to include attachments when they create invoices against purchase orders you 
submit to them. The Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments rule must be checked to see and enable 
this rule.
When the Require suppliers to send invoice attachments rule is checked, the following options are displayed:
○ For All Invoices
By default, this option is selected. Suppliers must add at least one attachment to all types of invoices.
○ For Material Invoices.
Buyers can select this option if they require suppliers to send an attachment for invoices containing only 
material line items. Suppliers must add at least one attachment to material invoices.
○ For Service Invoices
Buyers can select this option if they require suppliers to send an attachment for invoices containing a 
service line item.
This rule applies to both cXML invoices, and invoices generated from the Ariba Network user interface. This 
rule applies to non-PO invoices and contract invoices.
This rule can be configured for all suppliers or specific supplier groups.
For suppliers that submit invoices through cXML, if the supplier submits an invoice without an attachment, 
Ariba Network rejects the invoices. For suppliers that submit invoices online, they will see an error message if 
they try to submit an invoice without an attachment.
EDI and CSV invoices cannot have attachments; if you require suppliers to send invoice attachments, these 
invoices will fail. In this case, your suppliers can edit the failed invoice in the Ariba Network user interface to 
include an attachment, and resubmit the invoice.
● Require suppliers to send credit memo attachments.
This rule requires suppliers to include attachments when they create credit memos against purchase orders 
you submit to them. The Allow suppliers to send invoice attachments rule must be checked to see and 
enable this rule.
This rule applies to both cXML credit memos, and credit memos generated from the Ariba Network user 
interface. This rule applies to non-PO credit memos.
This rule can be configured for all suppliers or specific supplier groups.
For suppliers that submit credit memos through cXML, if the supplier submits a credit memo without an 
attachment, Ariba Network rejects the credit memo. For suppliers that submit credit memos online, they will 
see an error message if they try to submit a credit memo without an attachment.
● Allow suppliers to reuse invoice numbers. Controls whether suppliers can resend invoices in Canceled, 
Rejected, or Failed status with their original invoice numbers. By default, Ariba Network does not allow 
duplicate invoice numbers, and suppliers cannot resend invoices with these statuses unless they first change 
70 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
the invoice number. Ariba Network accepts invoice numbers from invoices that have been deleted for 18 
months.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Allow reuse of invoice numbers for all countries and regions, but disallow 
reuse of invoice numbers for canceled invoices for all countries or regions except the US, Canada and ‘Hong 
Kong, China’ (default).
● Allow suppliers to reuse invoice numbers from past calendar years. Controls whether suppliers can resend 
invoices with an invoice number previously used in a past calendar year. This rule is configurable only if Allow 
suppliers to reuse invoice numbers is checked.
 Note
If you receive invoices from Italian suppliers, it is recommended that you configure Allow suppliers to 
reuse invoice numbers from past calendar years as a country-based invoice rule for Italy.
In Italy, as per legal requirements, invoices must be numbered progressively, allowing univocal 
identification of each invoice. Numbers assigned to invoices must be consecutive and without gaps, 
sequentially numbered by entry date. In some cases, suppliers choose to use progressive numbering on an 
yearly basis, starting with invoice number 01, and continuing sequentially until the end of the calendar year; 
at the start of the next calendar year, invoice number 01 is used again, and invoice numbers follow 
sequentially thereafter.
● Allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at line item level.
Controls whether to allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details (price unit quantity, price unit, unit 
conversion, and pricing description) for a line item in non-service invoices as follows:
○ On non-PO invoices, if this rule is checked, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details.
○ On Ariba Network-validated contract invoices, if the contract allows suppliers to modify the unit price or 
add non-catalog items to the invoice, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details for an invoice line. If this 
rule is not checked, the invoice will fail validation when it is submitted.
○ On PO-based invoices or invoices based on blanket purchase orders (BPOs), suppliers can enter advanced 
pricing details if:
— The following three rules are checked: Allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at line item 
level, Allow supplier to change the unit price, and Allow suppliers to increase line item subtotals. If 
these rules are checked, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details on all PO or BPO-based invoices.
— The PO or BPO contains one or more line items with advanced pricing details, and the following two 
rules are checked: Allow suppliers to change the unit price and Allow suppliers to increase line item 
subtotals. In this case, even if the rule Allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at line item 
level is not checked, suppliers can enter advanced pricing details on the invoice if the PO or BPO contains 
items with advanced pricing details.
If the rule Allow suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at line item level is checked, but the rules 
Allow supplier to change the unit price and Allow suppliers to increase line item subtotals are 
unchecked, suppliers receive an error message if they try to enter advanced pricing details on PO or BPObased invoices.
When validating the subtotal price for a line item with advanced pricing details, the subtotal amount 
tolerance specified by the buyer for order confirmations and invoices is also considered. The unit price 
tolerance is used while validating the unit price for a line item.
To validate the unit price of a line item with advanced pricing details, Ariba Network uses the calculated 
unit price based on the pricing details as follows:
Calculated Unit Price = (Unit Conversion/Price Unit Quantity) * Unit Price of the line item
When the value of the subtotal exceeds the subtotal tolerance and the unit price exceeds the unit price 
tolerance specified by the buyer, Ariba Network rejects the invoices created by the supplier against the 
purchase order.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 71
Service invoices do not allow advanced pricing details on any lines.
● Allow suppliers to change advanced pricing details at the line-item level.
This rule controls whether suppliers are allowed toe edit Price Unit Quantity, Unit Conversion, Price Unit, and 
Pricing Description values on invoices.
 Note
The ability to edit Unit Price is governed by the rule Allow suppliers to change unit price.
If Allow suppliers to change advanced pricing details at the line-item level is unchecked, and Allow 
suppliers to enter advanced pricing details at the line-item level is checked, advanced pricing details cannot 
be added to or edited for existing line items; advanced pricing details can still be added to new line items that 
did not exist in the original purchase order.
● Allow the Bill To Address to be mapped to the corresponding system ID for non-PO invoices sent through 
cXML, CSV, or EDI.
This rule is applicable only for non-PO invoices sent through a cXML or CSV file by an integrated supplier. This 
rule controls if Ariba Network must map the Bill To Address with the corresponding system ID for the buyer 
account.
When this rule is checked, Ariba Network maps the Bill To Address with the corresponding system ID of the 
buyer account for all non-PO invoices sent through cXML or CSV documents.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Do not require for any country (default).
● Allow case-insensitive invoice matching.
Controls whether Ariba Network disregards the case in invoice numbers when matching invoice status updates 
to invoices. For SAP-enabled ERP systems, invoices received are automatically renumbered using uppercase 
characters (for example, inv-123 becomes INV-123). When there is case-insensitive invoice matching, Ariba 
Network matches invoice status updates to invoices that are numbered the same except for case. This 
configuration setting only affects how Ariba Network matches invoice status updates to invoices, not how 
invoices are matched to purchase orders.
● Allow suppliers to add allowances and charges to invoices.
This rule allows suppliers to do the following:
○ Create PO-based invoices that include all taxes, allowances, and charges cost elements from the purchase 
order on the invoice.
When the supplier creates PO-based invoices, the taxes, allowances, and charges information in the 
purchase order is carried over to the new invoice. That is, all the total landed cost fields in the new invoice 
are pre-populated with the taxes, allowances, and charge cost information from the purchase order. In 
addition, suppliers can add new allowances and charges, modify and remove the taxes, allowances, and 
charge cost elements carried over from the corresponding purchase order. Total landed cost information in 
the purchase order is also carried over to documents such as change orders, credit memo, and order 
confirmations.
○ Create non-PO invoices with taxes, allowances, charges and taxes on allowances, and charge cost 
elements.
○ Add allowances and charges as a rate or a fixed amount.
○ Add tax on the allowances and charges amount.
○ Add charge and tax on charge on the Credit Memo page.
Service invoices do not allow allowances or charges on any line items.
 Note
This rule does not prevent suppliers from adding discounts, shipping, and special handling charges to 
invoices.
72 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
If this rule is unchecked, suppliers cannot add new allowances and charges to invoices. However, they 
can change the description, dates, and the amount/rate of allowances and charges from the PO, and 
taxes.
Buyers can configure a list of allowances and charges that are available to suppliers when this rule is checked.
● ConfiJure list of allowances and charges
This link enables buyers to create a customized list of allowances and charges. When a customized list is 
created, the customized list is presented to suppliers instead of the default list when they are creating all types 
of invoices, including the following:
○ Purchase order invoices
○ Non-purchase order invoices
○ Credit memos
○ Line item credit memos
○ Service sheets
If the buyer does not choose to customize the list of allowances and charges, the current (default) list of 
allowances and charges is displayed to suppliers when creating invoices.
When creating an invoice, the supplier is presented with an alphabetically sorted list of allowances or charges. 
This applies to regular and non-purchase order invoices, and at header and line item levels.
If a buyer chooses to customize the list of values and doesn’t enter any value for some allowances or charges, 
then the supplier sees the default list of allowances and charges for the relevant list entry during the creation of 
an invoice. For example, if the buyer enters a customized list of charges but they leave the list of allowances 
empty, Ariba Network displays the default list of allowances to suppliers along with the buyer's customized list 
of charges.
If the buyer has added a customized list and has also checked the rule Allow suppliers to include taxes, 
freight, special handling, discounts, allowances, and charges on automatically-generated service sheets, 
the customized list is available in the invoice.
If the buyer has defined a list of customized allowances and charges, Ariba Network validates that the service 
codes entered for allowances and charges in the cXML invoice match the service codes defined in the list of 
customized allowances and charges. If the service codes of allowances and charges in the cXML don't match to 
the service codes of allowances and charges defined in the buyer's list, the invoice is rejected.
If a buyer customizes the list of allowances and charges while a supplier has invoices in the draft state that 
contain default allowances and charges, the supplier is prompted to use the customized list during the invoice 
submission.
If a supplier copies an existing invoice that contains default allowances and charges after the buyer customized 
the allowances and charges list, then the customized list is available on the invoice copy during the invoice 
creation.
 Note
Specific to users in France: If the parafiscal rule is checked and the buyer has defined a customized list of 
allowances and charges, then both the customized list and the parafiscal charges are available during 
invoice creation.
When a buyer opens this link, the Ariba Network displays a page where buyers can enter allowances and 
charges. In this page, buyers can add allowances and charges, and modify or delete them. This page contains 
the Service Code Name and Service Code fields.
● Require suppliers to include only shipped quantities on invoices.
This rule requires suppliers to create invoices based on the shipped quantities against a specific purchase 
order. Also, the rule prevents suppliers from creating invoices that exceed the shipped quantities limit. Since 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 73
service invoices are based on approved service sheet quantities rather than shipped quantities, this rule is 
ignored for service invoices.
 Note
If this rule is checked, suppliers must include only shipped quantities on invoices. Enabling this rule 
unchecks the rule Require suppliers to include only received quantities on invoices.
● Apply line-item shipped quantity tolerances to invoices
This rule has the following fields:
○ Upper tolerance limit
○ Lower tolerance limit
 Note
Ariba Network displays this rule ony if the Require suppliers to include only shipped quantities on 
invoices rule is enabled.
Buyers can specify the tolerance limits applicable for shipped quantities in the invoice. This allows suppliers to 
generate invoices from ship notices where the quantity shipped value in the invoice can differ from the 
quantities specified in the ship notice within the specified tolerance limits. Buyers can set both the upper and 
lower tolerance limits within which the suppliers are allowed to modify the shipped quantities in the generated 
invoice. When the Require suppliers to include only shipped quantities on invoices rule is enabled, by 
default, the upper and lower tolerance limits are not set to any value. Buyers can specify either one of the 
tolerance limits or both the upper and lower limits. Buyers can also enable this rule for supplier groups.
 Example
The buyer generates a purchase order for 100 units. Buyer sets the upper tolerance limit to 5% and the 
lower tolerance level to 10% for the shipped quantities in an invoice. Now, the upper tolerance level is 105 
units and the lower tolerance level is 90 units. Supplier can generate an invoice for the corresponding 
purchase order with the shipped quantity value ranging from 90 to 105 units.
 Example
The buyer generates a purchase order for 100 units and sets the upper tolerance limit to 10% and the lower 
tolerance level to 10% for the shipped quantities in an invoice. Now, the supplier generates two ship 
notices. The supplier specifies 30 units in the first ship notice and 70 units in the second ship notice. When 
an invoice is generated against ship notice 1, the supplier can enter a value ranging from a maximum of 33 
units to a minimum of 27 units in the invoice. When an invoice is generated against ship notice 2, the 
supplier can enter a value ranging from a maximum of 77 units to a minimum of 63 units in the invoice.
● Require references to ship notices on invoices
This rule allows suppliers to flip a PO to an invoice for shipped quantities. The invoice includes references to 
ship notices for each line item. If there are multiple ship notices for a PO, suppliers can select which ship 
notices to invoice against.
● Require suppliers to include only received quantities on invoices.
This rule requires suppliers to create invoices based on the received quantities against a specific purchase 
order. Also, the rule prevents suppliers from creating invoices that exceed the received quantities set limit. 
Since service invoices are based on approved service sheet quantities rather than received quantities, this rule 
is ignored for service invoices. This rule is also ignored for blanket orders.
74 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
 Note
○ If this rule is checked, suppliers must include only received quantities on invoices. Enabling this rule 
unchecks the rule Require suppliers to include only shipped quantities on invoices.
○ If the purchase order contains line item quantity or unit price tolerances, Ariba Network compares the 
purchase order tolerances with shipped or received quantities set limit. Ariba Network then uses the 
following method to calculate the maximum allowed limit to create invoices based on shipped or 
received quantity:
For shipped quantities:
Maximum allowed limit = Minimum of (purchase order item quantity + purchase order tolerances) and 
shipped quantity.
For received quantities:
Maximum allowed limit = Minimum of (purchase order item quantity + purchase order tolerances) and 
received quantity.
○ There is a special entitlement that allows buyers to apply receipt-based invoice verification at the line 
item level. Enabling this entitlement forces a three-way match between PO, receipt, and invoice 
quantities for any PO line items in which a control key specifies receipt-based invoice verification. For 
example, the following control key specifies receipt-based invoice verification for a line item:
<ControlKeys>
 <InvoiceInstruction verificationType="goodsReceipt" /> 
</ControlKeys>
PO line items without this control key do not require a receipt for invoicing, resulting in a two-way 
match between PO and invoice quantities.
 Note
The entitlement to apply receipt-based invoice verification at the line item level is disabled by 
default. To enable it, have your Designated Support Contact log a service request.
○ If this rule and the rule Require references to receipts on invoices are both checked, buyers can 
reference the original goods receipt in goods receipt returns and reversals. Or, if references to original 
receipt in returns or reversals are missing, the system uses ship notice references. With this 
information, Ariba Network determines the correct available quantity to be invoiced. This capability 
eliminates the need for suppliers to adjust these quantities manually.
 Note
When ship notices references are used, the system cannot use a ship notice that more than one 
receipt references with received quantities.
● Require references to receipts on invoices
This rule allows suppliers to flip a PO to an invoice for received quantities. The invoice includes references to 
receipts for each line item. If there are multiple receipts for a PO, suppliers can select which receipts to invoice 
against.
 Note
○ You can only enable one of the following two rules at a time:
○ Require references to receipts on invoices
○ Require references to ship notices on invoices
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 75
○ The purchase order has one associated receipt. When the supplier creates an invoice, it includes only 
items from that receipt.
○ The purchase order has one associated receipt with both received and returned items. When the 
supplier creates an invoice, it cannot exceed the balance of received and returned quantities for each 
item on the receipt:
sum(received quantity) – sum(returned quantity)
For example, if 10 items are received and 5 are returned, 5 can be invoiced.
○ The purchase order has multiple associated receipts. If the supplier creates an invoice, they can select 
which receipts with positive received values to invoice against. Again, the invoiced quantity cannot 
exceed the balance of received and returned quantities for each item.
○ If the buyer checked the Require suppliers to include only received quantities on invoices rule but 
unchecked the Require references to receipts on invoices rule, then the supplier cannot select which 
receipts to invoice against for a purchase order, although they can invoice up to the balance of received 
and returned quantities for each item.
○ If this rule and the rule Require suppliers to include only received quantities are both checked, 
buyers can reference the original goods receipt in goods receipt returns and reversals. Or, if references 
to original receipt in returns or reversals are missing, the system uses ship notice references. With this 
information, Ariba Network determines the correct available quantity to be invoiced. This capability 
eliminates the need for suppliers to adjust these quantities manually.
 Note
When ship notices references are used, the system cannot use a ship notice that more than one 
receipt references with received quantities.
● Require suppliers to include the Polish invoice title for invoices and credit memos in EDI or cXML invoices.
Country-based invoice rule for Poland only.
This rule controls if invoices and credit memos that Polish suppliers create in their Ariba Network account must 
include the Polish document title for invoices and credit memos in the extrinsic element InvoiceTitle in the 
invoice cXML. This allows auditors to identify the type of invoice document in Polish in the invoice cXML when 
reviewing invoices in the invoice archive.
If this rule is checked, it adds Polish document titles automatically to the invoice cXML for invoices created by a 
Polish supplier through the Ariba Network user interface. Polish suppliers that submit invoices through cXML, 
EDI, or CSV must configure their backend system to include the InvoiceTitle extrinsic with the following exact 
values in their invoice documents:
For invoices: Faktura
For credit memos: Faktura Korygująca
● Allow Ariba Network to send failed invoices to buyer system.
When this rule is checked, Ariba Network sends failed invoices to the buyer's system. This rule does not apply 
to ICS invoices (invoices sent from an invoice conversion service).
● Allow suppliers to create multiple invoices for an amount-based service item.
When this rule is checked, it allows suppliers to create multiple invoices on amount-based lines on a service 
purchase order. When the rule is unchecked, suppliers can create only one invoice for amount-based lines on a 
service purchase order.
● Allow suppliers to create invoices directly from service POs without a service sheet.
This rule is available if SAP Ariba has enabled the entitlement of the same name in the buyer account. The rule 
enables suppliers to flip a service order with item groups into a service invoice without first creating a service 
sheet. The invoice flipped from the service order maintains the same hierarchy shown in the order. This rule is 
for buyers who manage their service sheets outside of the Ariba Network. If this rule is checked, suppliers 
cannot create service sheets for service orders.
76 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
When this rule is unchecked, the following rule is available to configure: Auto-generate service sheets from 
service invoices.
● Require suppliers to specify a delivery note date for each material item on an invoice.
This rule allows suppliers to specify the delivery date for each material line-item in an invoice. Sometimes 
buyers do not accept service sheets and ship notices for transactions. However, the buyer may need to know 
date-related information such as the delivery date for each material line item. When this rule is checked, 
suppliers can specify the delivery date for each material line-item on the Create Invoice page.
● Require suppliers to provide start and end dates on service invoices.
Check At line level to require suppliers to include both start and end dates for service invoice line items. The 
rule applies only to service items, not material items. Check At header to require suppliers to include both start 
and end dates at the service invoice header. When either option is checked, the subrule Do not allow invoices 
for services that are still in progress is available.
 Note
If Ariba Network generates service sheets automatically and start and end dates are required in service 
sheets, then they are also required in service invoices, regardless of this rule’s settings.
Default setting (for both line level and header): No
● Auto-generate service sheets from service invoices.
This rule allows suppliers to skip the manual service sheet creation process, generating service sheets 
automatically instead. When this rule is checked, suppliers can create service invoices for each service line, and 
the service sheets are generated automatically and sent to the customer for approval.
This rule is available only if the rule Allow suppliers to create invoices directly from service POs without a 
service sheet is not checked. When buyers allow suppliers to create service invoices without service sheets, 
suppliers cannot submit manual or automatically generated service sheets through the Ariba Network.
● Allow suppliers to edit service sheet invoice dates and retain them when using auto-generated service 
sheets.
When this rule is checked, suppliers enter invoice dates in invoices and Ariba Network retains them for use in 
auto-generated service sheets. If this rule is unchecked, Ariba Network uses the date the service sheet is 
approved by the buyer, which is usually later than what suppliers expect. Enabling this rule produces the 
payment timeline that suppliers expect.
This rule works with the rules for invoice back dating and future dating. Ariba Network evaluates the back 
dating and future dating rules during invoice creation, not when the service sheet is approved and the invoice is 
released.
This rule is available only if the rule Auto-generate service sheets from service invoices is checked.
● Ignore return items when creating an invoice.
When the rule is checked, items marked for return are excluded from standard invoices. This also excludes 
return items from line-item credit memos because they are created from invoices. The rule is unchecked by 
default.
This rule allows buyers to prevent suppliers from invoicing for the difference between regular items and return 
items. When this rule is checked, suppliers must submit a regular invoice for goods and a separate credit 
memo for return items, keeping the two transactions transparent and auditable.
When this rule is unchecked, suppliers can invoice for the difference between regular items and return items 
(that is, they can add both material goods and return items to standard invoices and line item credit memos).
● Require suppliers to provide negative tax on allowances on invoices.
When the rule is checked, buyers can control how suppliers can make changes to the allowances section of an 
invoice. Buyers can require suppliers to enter negative taxes on allowances in an invoice. When this subrule is 
enabled, in credit memos, suppliers can enter only positive values as taxes on allowances. The new subrule is 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 77
applied to allowances at both the line item level and the header level, and to all types of invoices and credit 
memos.
Service sheet rules
The following rules are located in the Service Sheet Rules section:
● Require suppliers to create an order confirmatLon before creating a service sheet.
Requires suppliers to partially or fully confirm an order before creating any service sheets from it.
Default setting: No
● Require suppliers to provide approver information on service sheets.
Requires suppliers to provide the email address of the person at buyer's company responsible for approving 
the service sheet (and therefore that the work was completed according to the service sheet description) when 
creating a service sheet.
If the supplier specifies the email address in the approver details section within the Additional Details section 
on the service entry sheet page, Ariba Network sends email notifications to the approver whenever 
modifications are made to the service entry sheet or if the status of the service entry sheet changes.
Default setting: Yes
● Require suppliers to create an order confirmatLon before creating a service sheet.
Requires suppliers to partially or fully confirm a purchase order before creating any service sheets from it.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to send service sheet attachments.
Allows suppliers to add attachments to service sheets. Service sheets only support attachments at the header 
level.
Default setting: No
● Your procurement application can download service sheet attachments (MIME multipart messages).
Allows the buyer's procurement application to download header-level service sheet attachments if the buyer 
allows suppliers to add them.
The additional setting, Send URLs to view attachments on Ariba Network, is also unchecked by default.
Default setting: No
● Require suppliers to send service sheet attachments.
Requires suppliers to add at least one attachment to each service sheet. If buyers check this rule, the buyers 
must also check the Allow Suppliers to send service sheet attachments rule.
 Note
There is no way for suppliers to add attachments to service sheets uploaded as CSV files. If buyers check 
this rule for suppliers who upload service sheets as CSV files, their uploads will fail and they must log into 
Ariba Network and edit and resubmit the failed service sheets with attachments.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to add ad hoc line items to service sheets.
Allows suppliers to add items to service sheets that were not included in the original order. If buyer places 
unplanned service orders and the buyer's Ariba Network buyer account is not integrated with SAP Ariba 
Procurement solutions, the buyer should check this setting so that suppliers can add items as they fulfill the 
orders.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to change units of measure on service sheets.
78 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
Allows suppliers to change units of measure on service sheets. If buyers check this rule, the Allow suppliers to 
increase item quantities on service sheets rule is automatically checked as well. Buyers cannot set an 
exception tolerance when this rule is checked.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to increase item quantities on service sheets.
Allows suppliers to increase item quantities on service sheets without restriction. Buyers cannot set an 
exception tolerance when this rule is checked.
If buyers uncheck this rule, suppliers can only increase item quantities on service sheets up to the tolerance 
level that the buyers specify. The default exception tolerance is 0%.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to change unit prices on service sheets.
Allows suppliers to change unit prices on service sheets without restriction. Buyers cannot set an exception 
tolerance when this rule is checked.
If buyers uncheck this rule, suppliers can only change unit prices on service sheets within the tolerance level 
that buyers specify. To set unit price tolerance, select Check Price Tolerance.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to change subtotal amounts on service sheets
Allows suppliers to change subtotal amounts on service sheets without restrictions. Buyers cannot set 
exception and absolute amount tolerances when this rule is checked.
If buyers uncheck this rule, suppliers can only change subtotal amounts on service sheets up to either the 
exception tolerance or the absolute amount tolerance, whichever computed amount is smaller. For example, if 
the subtotal is $100 and buyer sets an exception tolerance of 15% and an absolute amount tolerance of $100, 
the supplier can increase the subtotal up to $115. However, if the subtotal is $1000, the supplier can only 
increase the subtotal to $100, since 15% of $1000 is $150 and exceeds the absolute amount tolerance.
The default exception tolerance is 0%; there is no default absolute amount tolerance.
 Note
This rule does not apply to unplanned order lines.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to create multiple service sheets for an amount-based service item
Allows suppliers to create multiple service sheets for an amount-based service item.
If buyers check this rule, suppliers can create multiple service sheets on amount-based lines on a service 
purchase order.
If this rule is unchecked, suppliers can create only one service sheet for amount-based lines on a service 
purchase order. If a supplier attempts to create multiple service sheets against an amount-based service line 
purchase order when the rule is unchecked, Ariba Network displays an error message.
Default setting: Yes
● Allow suppliers to include taxes, freight, special handling, discounts, allowances, and charges, on 
automatically-generated service sheets
Allows suppliers to include other charges such as taxes, freight, special handling, discounts, allowances, and 
charges on automatically-generated service sheets if buyers' procurement application supports them. These 
charges also appear on the related invoice.
If buyer's procurement application does not support the processing of additional charges on a service sheet, 
the buyer should uncheck this rule. If the rule is unchecked, additional charges are excluded from 
automatically-generated service sheets.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to include multiple parent PO lines per service sheet
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 79
Allows suppliers to include multiple parent PO lines per service sheet. If buyers check this rule, suppliers won't 
be prompted to select an outline item when they create a service sheet or an invoice for the order. Instead, all 
parent PO lines are automatically added to the service sheet and the invoice.
If the rule is unchecked, suppliers can include only one parent PO line per service sheet.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to reuse service sheet numbers
Allows suppliers to reuse a service sheet number if the service sheet has been rejected or failed. Select at least 
one of the two options, Rejected and Failed.
If buyers disable this rule, suppliers can’t reuse service sheet numbers. If a service sheet is rejected or failed, 
they must use a new number when they resubmit it.
Default setting: No
● Require suppliers to create service entry sheets where the line item quantity is not zero
Prevents suppliers from creating service entry sheets where the line item quantity is zero.
Default setting: No
● Do not allow part number to exceed specLfied characters for ad hoc line items
Buyers can prevent suppliers from specifying part numbers (for ad hoc line items in service sheets) which 
exceed the configured number of characters. The maximum allowed number is 99.
● Require suppliers to provide description for ad hoc line items
Requires suppliers to provide part descriptions for ad hoc line items.
Default setting: No
● Require suppliers to provide line item quantity for ad hoc line items
Requires suppliers to provide line item quantities for ad hoc line items in service sheets.
Default setting: No
● Require suppliers to provide account assignment information
Buyers can specify U (Unknown) as the value for the account assignment category for service line items on 
purchase orders. Buyers can enable this rule to ensure that suppliers submit service sheets only after they 
replace the value U (Unknown) with the appropriate account assignment category values. Suppliers can punch 
in to SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing to retrieve the appropriate value for the account assignment category and 
then submit their service sheets.
Default setting: No
● Allow suppliers to create correction service sheets
Allow suppliers to create a correction service sheet for those service sheets which are invoiced. Suppliers must 
enter a negative quantity value in the correction entry sheet. While creating a correction entry sheet, suppliers 
cannot:
○ Copy a line item.
○ Edit details of the Price, Part# / Description, and Subtotal fields.
○ Delete line items.
 Note
While creating a correction service entry sheet:
○ Suppliers cannot copy or create an invoice for an approved correction service entry sheet.
○ Suppliers cannot enter a negative quantity per line item which exceeds the total quantity value of the 
original service sheet.
Default setting: No

Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
List of allowances and charges
Buyers can create a customized list of allowances and charges.
When a customized list is created, the customized list is presented to suppliers instead of the default list when they 
are creating all types of invoices, including the following:
● Purchase order invoices
● Non-purchase order invoices
● Credit memos
● Line item credit memos
● Service sheets
If the buyer does not customize the list of allowances and charges, the current (default) list of allowances and 
charges is displayed to suppliers when creating invoices both at the header and the line item levels.
If they prefer, buyers can choose to customize only one of the allowances and charges lists. For example, if the 
buyer enters a customized list of charges but they leave the list of allowances empty, Ariba Network displays the 
default list of allowances to suppliers along with the buyer's customized list of charges.
If the buyer has added a customized list and has also checked the Allow suppliers to include taxes, freight, 
special handling, discounts, allowances, and charges on automatically-generated service sheets rule, then the 
customized list is available in the invoice.
If the buyer has defined a list of customized allowances and charges, Ariba Network validates that the service 
codes entered for allowances and charges in the cXML invoice match the service codes defined in the list of 
customized allowances and charges. If the service codes of allowances and charges in the cXML don't match to the 
service codes of allowances and charges defined in the buyer's list, the invoice is rejected.
If a buyer customizes the list of allowances and charges while a supplier has invoices in the draft state that contain 
default allowances and charges, the supplier is prompted to use the customized list during the invoice submission.
If a supplier copies an existing invoice that contains default allowances and charges after the buyer customized the 
allowances and charges list, then the customized list is available on the invoice copy during the invoice creation.
For users in France
If the parafiscal rule is checked and the buyer has defined a customized list of allowances and charges, then both 
the customized list and the parafiscal charges are available during invoice creation.
PO invoice fields
The following rules specify whether suppliers can change values while creating invoices for purchase orders:
● Allow suppliers to add line items to PO invoices.
This rule allows suppliers to bill for items that do not appear in the original purchase order.
● Allow suppliers to change auxiliary part ID.
This rule allows suppliers to edit the Auxiliary Part ID field on invoices.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 81
 Note
At the item level, suppliers can provide an auxiliary part ID to further identify items that have newer or 
replacement part numbers, particularly for orders of non-catalog items.
● Require invoice Sold To Name and Country to match PO Bill To Name and Country (or Sold To information 
if available).
(For VAT compliance) This rule applies only to invoices against a single purchase order. If this rule is checked, 
the rule Copy Bill To address on purchase orders to Sold To address on invoices is automatically checked in 
the Online Invoice Form Rules section.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Require for all countries (default).
● Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice.
This rule copies line item tax information from a purchase order when it is flipped to a standard invoice or when 
the Ariba Network generates a standard invoice automatically based on a receipt submitted by the buyer. This 
rule does not copy header-level taxes, and it is available only for buyers that integrate directly with their ERP or 
SAP Ariba Procurement solutions.
If you don't want suppliers to add or change line item taxes, check the Make line item tax on invoice view-only 
box. If suppliers change a line item quantity, taxes are adjusted.
This rule does not apply to line item credit memos. For line item credit memos, taxes at line item level default 
from the invoice and not from the purchase order, even when this rule is enabled. The following scenarios apply 
for this rule:
○ When the Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice rule is enabled and the sub-rule Make line 
item tax on invoice view-only is disabled, taxes are copied from the invoice for line item credit memos, not 
from the purchase order. Suppliers can manually update the taxes on the invoice for changes to be 
reflected on the line item credit memo.
○ When the Copy tax from purchase order to standard invoice rule and the sub-rule Make line item tax on 
invoice view-only are both enabled, taxes on the line item credit memo are read-only and cannot be 
changed.
PO and non-PO invoice fields
● Allow invoices to be back-dated the specLfied number of days.
The number of calendar days suppliers can back-date invoices (a value of zero rejects back-dated invoice). SAP 
Ariba recommends to not allow back-dating of invoices. See Invoice dates and date of issue [page 26].
● Allow shipping tax entered at header level
For Ariba Invoice Automation customers: This rule allows suppliers to enter the tax amount for the shipping 
amount if the shipping amount is specified at the header level.
Buying organization that are using SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing or SAP Ariba Invoice Management must not 
check this rule since these solutions allow shipping taxes on invoice line level only. The rule Allow suppliers to 
add shipping and special handling costs and tax details as separate invoice lines allows adding taxes to 
shipping or special handling charges at the line level.
● Require suppliers to provide their tax ID on invoices.
Suppliers must include their tax ID on invoices.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Do not require for any country except Belgium and France (default).
● Allow suppliers to add shipping and special handling costs and tax details as separate invoice lines.
For VAT compliance, Ariba Network can create a service line containing shipping and special handling costs 
and the corresponding taxes. Shipping and special handling costs are taxable in Europe, the Middle East, and 
Asia.

● Require suppliers to provide order information
This rule is applicable for non-PO invoices or credit memos. If the rule is checked, a supplier must enter a value 
in at least one of the Order Information fields (Customer order #, Sales order #, Contract #). If the rule is 
unchecked, the values in the Order Information fields are optional.
This rule currently applies only to invoices entered manually in Ariba Network. For non-PO invoices submitted 
through EDI or cXML, including ICS invoices (invoices sent from an invoice conversion service), order 
information is not required. In a future release, SAP Ariba will strictly enforce this rule regardless of whether the 
invoice is manually entered in Ariba Network or submitted through EDI or cXML.
● Allow suppliers to enter discounts in the invoice header
Suppliers can be prevented from entering header level discounts and taxes, which is particularly important 
since many invoice lines can have different discount rates.
This rule can be specified at the default transactions rule level, supplier group rule level, and the country rule 
level.
If the rule is checked, suppliers can enter discounts on the invoice header or at line level on PO-based and nonPO invoices. If this rule is not checked, then suppliers can only enter discount at the line level.

invoices to you.
If the SAP Ariba procurement solution supports taxes and charges on purchase orders, uncheck this rule to 
ensure correct calculation of the unit price of invoice line items.
● Allow invoices to be future-dated the specLfied number of days.
This rule allows the buyer administrator to configure future dates on invoices for a specified number of days 
(up to 365) beyond the current date. To reject future-dated invoices, enter 0.
● Require suppliers to provide their supplier legal form of their business on invoices.
If this rule is checked, suppliers have to provide the legal form of their business on the invoice, such as such as 
Inc., Ltd. S.A., S.A.S, or other. To pass the rule, suppliers must fill in the Supplier Legal Form field.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: Disallow for all countries except Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (default).

Online invoice forms
These rules specify how online invoices are handled:
● Allow suppliers to use remittance addresses without remittance IDs.
Allows suppliers to select remittance addresses that do not have unique IDs in the case where the invoicing 
application requires each address to have an ID. Otherwise, suppliers must select remittance addresses that 
have IDs unless none of the remittance addresses include a remittance ID.
If the rule is deactivated, and none of the remittance addresses is assigned a remittance ID, this rule does not 
prevent the suppliers from submitting invoices without a remittance ID. The remittance address of the invoice 
will be defaulted to the address suppliers have configured in their Basic Profile configuration.
● Allow suppliers to change Ship To information as shown on purchase orders.

Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 87
● Default Bill To Address
Specifies the default Bill To address used for invoices from supplier groups. This field is mainly for non-PO 
invoices.
● Default Sold To Address
Specifies the default Sold To address used for invoices from supplier groups. This field is mainly for non-PO 
invoices and is required in countries that require VAT compliance.
● ConfiJure list of Sold To Addresses with VAT IDs.
Allows buyers to create a list of Sold To addresses and, if necessary, associate them with one or more VAT IDs. 
When a supplier creates a PO invoice or a non-PO invoice, Ariba Network displays the list and allows the 
supplier to choose an address. If a VAT ID is associated with the address, Ariba Network displays it on the 
invoice.
As a best practice, SAP Ariba recommends that buyers using Ariba Purchase Order Automation or SAP Ariba 
Invoice Management to import purchase orders from an external system include the Sold To address and VAT 
ID in the purchase order cXML to eliminates the need for the supplier to provide this information on the invoice.
● Copy Bill To address on purchase orders to Sold To address on invoices.
Specifies whether to use Bill To addresses on purchase orders as Sold To addresses on invoices. This rule is 
automatically checked if the Require invoice Sold To Name and Country to match PO Bill To Name and 
Country (or Sold To information if available) rule is checked.
As a best practice, SAP Ariba recommends that buyers using SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing check this rule.
● Copy selected Sold To list entry into Non-PO invoice or Non-PO credit memo Bill To section.
(For VAT compliance) This setting appears when one or more Sold To addresses are configured. Ariba Network 
populates the Bill To section on non-PO invoices or non-PO credit memos with the address information from 
the Sold To list entry selected by suppliers.
● Ariba Network does not allow multi-ERP customers that have configured multiple Bill To and Sold To addresses 
to specify this invoicing rule.
Some of the rules in the Invoice Fields section allow Ariba Network to accumulate and track invoice quantities and 
subtotals against associated purchase orders (invoice aggregation). When a supplier reaches the value limit plus 
the exception tolerance specified, Ariba Network disables further invoicing against the purchase order. If suppliers 
exceed the limit, Ariba Network rejects the invoices.
Ariba Network displays invoiced subtotal amounts in purchase order lists. It also displays invoiced quantities and 
subtotal amounts in the purchase order details page. If an invoice is canceled or rejected, all the aggregation data 
for that invoice is deleted. Suppliers can use credit memos to adjust aggregated amounts. Ariba Network does not 
aggregate information-only invoices.
PO and BPO invoice fields
These rules specify whether suppliers can change values while creating invoices for purchase orders or blanket 
purchase orders. Check the rule Enable BPO-specLfic invoice rules to configure these rules for BPOs.
● Allow suppliers to change the currency for unit price.
This rule allows suppliers to bill for items in any currency. If a buyer does not allow a change in currency, then 
suppliers must use the same currency as shown on the original purchase order. This rule does not apply to 
invoice lines based on service sheets, where the currency is always based on the service sheet and is never 
editable on the invoice.
● Allow suppliers to change the unit price.
88 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules
Suppliers might need to increase the unit price for an item due to variations in pricing or availability. If this rule 
is checked, Ariba Network does not check unit prices. If unchecked (default), the buyer can click Check Price 
Tolerance and enter a percentage by which invoice unit prices can exceed those on purchase orders.
For example, if there is a unit price tolerance of 10% for an item that is listed at $100, a supplier could price the 
item on the invoice up to $110, a supplier can price the item in the invoice up to $110. An exception tolerance of 
0% allows no change in unit prices.
This rule does not apply to invoice lines based on service sheets, where the unit price is always based on the 
service sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
● Allow suppliers to change the unit of measure.
Suppliers might need to change how an item is packaged or delivered, particularly for non-catalog items. This 
rule does not apply to invoice lines based on service sheets, where the unit of measure is always based on the 
service sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
● Allow suppliers to increase item quantities.
Suppliers might need to increase item quantity for best pricing or shipment, particularly for non-catalog items. 
If this rule is checked, Ariba Network does not check invoice quantities. If unchecked, Ariba Network displays 
an exception tolerance field. This rule does not apply to invoice lines based on service sheets, where the item 
quantity is always based on the service sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
● Allow suppliers to increase line item subtotals.
Suppliers might need to increase line item subtotals due to variations in pricing or availability. If this rule is 
checked, Ariba Network does not check invoice line item subtotals. If unchecked, Ariba Network displays two 
exception tolerance text boxes, named Exception Tolerance and Absolute Amount Tolerance. In the 
Exception Tolerance text box, enter a percentage by which invoice line item subtotals can exceed those on 
purchase orders.
For example, if the buyer orders a line item that subtotals $50, an exception tolerance of 10% allows suppliers 
to invoice that line item for up to $55. An exception tolerance of 0% allows no increase in line item subtotals.
In the Absolute Amount Tolerance text box, enter an absolute monetary exception amount. For example, the 
buyer might allow a percentage exception of 10%, but not allow any exception over $100. If the buyer does not 
have an absolute monetary exception limit, then this text box is blank. Ariba Network converts the monetary 
exception amount to the currency specified in the invoice if necessary.
If the buyer wants suppliers to view and edit the pricing details for blanket purchase orders, then the buyer 
must define both the above rules in the Blanket Purchase Order Invoice Rules section also.
This rule does not apply to invoice lines based on service sheets, where the line item subtotal is always based 
on the service sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
● Allow suppliers to change part numbers.
Suppliers might need to use newer or replacement part numbers, particularly for non-catalog items. This rule 
does not apply to invoice lines based on service sheets, where the part number is always based on the service 
sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
PO, BPO, and non-PO invoice fields
These rules specify whether suppliers can change values while creating invoices. Check the rule Enable BPOspecLfic invoice rules to configure these rules for BPOs.
● Require suppliers to provide line item descriptions.
Each invoice line item on the invoice must have a description. This rule does not apply to invoice lines based on 
service sheets, where the description is always based on the service sheet and is never editable on the invoice.
● Require suppliers to choose from your list of valid tax values.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Invoice rules C O N F I D E N T I A L 89
Buyers can create a list of valid tax rates (for example, withholding tax) that suppliers must use on their online 
invoices. Buyers can also apply tax rate validation to invoices submitted through EDI or cXML.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: By default, this rule is set to not require suppliers to choose from a list of 
valid tax value. However, SAP Ariba recommends that buyers configure valid tax values for the respective 
countries and require that suppliers choose from that list.
● Allow suppliers to create a tax rate and type for invoices and credit memos.
Buyers can allow suppliers to specify their own tax values when generating an invoice or credit memo, instead 
of using the buyer’s predefined tax values.
Country-based Invoice Rule Setting: By default, this rule is set to allow for all countries. However, SAP Ariba 
recommends to set this rule to not allow supplier-created tax rates and types and require suppliers to choose 
from a list of valid tax values.
● Allow net amounts to exceed subtotals.
Suppliers might need to increase invoice special handling, shipping, and tax amounts. When this rule is 
checked, Ariba Network does not check invoice net amounts; otherwise Ariba Network displays an exception 
tolerance field.

Digital signature concepts
Digital signatures (also called eSignatures) provide an electronic method of authenticating the creators of 
documents and of ensuring content integrity and authenticity. They are also used to meet country-specific
requirements, including VAT.
Digital signatures are based using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). PKI is a technique that associates electronic 
credentials (called certificates) with two cryptographic keys that are related so that what is encoded with one can 
only be decoded with the other. The keys cannot be derived from one another. One key (the private key) is kept 
secret by the holder of the certificate; the other key (the public key) is published as part of the certificate. The 
certificate is issued by a Certification Authority (CA) which uses secure processes and technology to uniquely 
identify the certificate holder. The CA also publishes data showing whether or not a certificate has been revoked. If 
the certificate holder uses their private key to encrypt data, then anyone holding the associated public key can 
technically check the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the signed data.
Digital signatures enable buying organizations and suppliers to prove that an invoice is unaltered. If a digitally 
signed invoice is changed after it is signed, the signature is invalid.
Ariba Network can apply a digital signature to invoices generated online, through cXML, EDI, or CSV. SAP Ariba 
compares the originating and destination countries on the invoice to determine whether the invoice should be 
digitally signed. If either country is listed on the SAP Ariba invoice signing matrix, Ariba Network digitally signs the 
invoice. In some cases, Ariba Network applies digital signatures with both the originating and the destination 
country certificates.
When an invoice meets SAP Ariba invoice signing matrix criteria, Ariba Network automatically applies the relevant 
digital signatures to invoices regardless of how they are submitted. The supplier automatically sees the following 
text at the top of the invoice entry page when submitting an invoice online:
Confirm and submit this document. It will be electronically signed according to the compliance map and your 
customer’s invoice rules. The document’s originating country is:<originating country>. The document’s 
destination is:<destination country>.
After submitting the invoice, the supplier sees a confirmation that the invoice is digitally signed.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Digital signature process C O N F I D E N T I A L 91
 Note
Ariba Network does not apply a digital signature for CC invoices (invoices that are entered by the buyer in their 
invoicing solution based on a paper invoice and send to Ariba Network as a CC invoice) or ICS invoices (invoices 
sent from an invoice conversion service provider).

Ariba Network e-signing methods [page 100]
Digital signing prerequisites
Prior to the invoice creation and signing process two essential steps must be in place:
● The digital signing service provider must acquire a certificate that complies with the country requirements.
● The invoice creator and receiver have to accept agreements that mandate SAP Ariba to create, sign and verify 
invoice data.
The process involves the following parties who are considered to be a) separate legal entities and b) using 
physically separated hardware components:
● Certificate Authority (CA): accredited as a Trust Center
● eSigning ASP/Hub: The electronic signing and verification of invoices is executed by a third party under 
contract with SAP Ariba for this service, which is currently TrustWeaver AB.
● Invoice issuer: participant who creates invoices (supplier). In Europe and other countries where SAP Ariba 
applies a digital signature, the invoice issuers authorize SAP Ariba’s subcontractor TrustWeaver AB to issue the 
e-invoices on their behalf.
● Invoice receiver: participant who receives invoices (buyer).
The digital signing service provider ensures that only valid certificates are being used. This process is managed 
through an extensive case management system controlling issues and life cycle events in relation to keys and 
certificates (for example, the system administrators received automated notification emails in time for appropriate 
renewal).
The potential event of a confidentiality breach is covered via an incident response plan. To prevent any such case 
only authorized administrators are allowed to log on to servers and infrastructure components using individual 
accounts. Logon is not allowed without a valid case number. All logon activities are monitored and reviewed on a 
daily basis and verified by the Security Officer on a weekly basis. Any logon attempt (successful or unsuccessful) 
sends alerts to administrators and Security Officer. All changes to the service follow defined and approved 
checklists and follow up adhere to defined procedures.
The eSigning service provider (or an authorized representative) purchases the cards from third party CAs that have 
been verified to issue compliant certificates following the normal order process provided by the CA in question. 
Statutorily, the eSigning service provider may be represented by the CEO or Board members. Where pseudonyms 
are available under the applicable laws of the country in question and if the CA offers this as a service for the 
appropriate certificates, the authorized representatives (or their appointees, see above) may choose to use the 
eSigning service provider’s name as a pseudonym.
92 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Digital signature process
Only the Authorized Representative Signatory has access and is in constant control of the physical whereabouts 
and codes of the certificate cards, both when they are slotted and when they are not slotted.
The authority to invalidate certificates is given to the eSigning service provider via a specific agreement, with each 
certificate holder so that in cases of (reasonably suspected) private key compromise the deployed private key 
would be revoked (under obligation).

SAP Ariba Terms of Use
Buyers and suppliers must follow a click-through process to accept the Terms of Use (TOU) which logs the user’s 
full name, email address, and date of acceptance. This is important because SAP Ariba's Terms of Use serves as 
“an electronic invoicing mandate” between SAP Ariba, as a service provider, and each trading partner. As defined
by the law in France, for example, the mandate must specify that suppliers are entirely and solely responsible for 
their own invoicing obligations and consequences with regards to VAT.
In addition, the mandate must also indicate that the trading partner entrusts the service provider, such as SAP 
Ariba, with the issuance of invoices—and that the buyer is prepared to accept invoices from the service provider. 
For suppliers the TOU is available on the bottom right corner of each page in their Ariba Network account (including 
on the logon page). For buyers, the TOU is available when they first log in.

communicated, and authenticates the source of the data.
98 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Digital signature process
The affected process points (illustrated in the previous diagram) are as follows:
● Online invoice data entry (step IC 01.2) uses HTTPS. Ariba Network authenticates online sessions by requiring 
users to log in with a unique user ID/password pair. It uses Data Encryption Standard (DES) software to encrypt 
account passwords before storing them. Each organization can view only its own information.
● cXML, EDI or CSV submitted invoice data (step IC 01.1) uses HTTPS. Ariba Network provides two methods for 
authenticating received cXML documents: a) Shared Secret (default), or b) digital certificate.
● Transmission to the eSigning service (step IC 03) uses HTTPS and digital certificate.
● cXML transmission of invoice to the buyer’s system (step IC 09.2) uses HTTPS. Ariba Network provides two 
methods for authenticating: a) Shared Secret (default), or b) digital certificate. In addition, the invoice is 
digitally signed and an integrity check is performed for customers using SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing, SAP 
Ariba Invoice Management, or Ariba Buyer 8.2.
 Note
SAP Ariba enforces a minimum of 128-bit encryption for HTTPS, which is the currently acceptable standard in 
terms of encryption strength.
Determination for certLficate selection
The invoice process step IC 03 (refer to the previous diagram) requires extraction of the invoice’s originating 
(From) and destination (To) country to determine if digital signature is supported and required based on the SAP 
Ariba eSigning supported country list.
To determine the originating (From) country, the Ariba Network first checks the supplier’s VAT ID country prefix. If 
that isn’t available, SAP Ariba uses the From address’ country code on the invoice. If a supplier tax representative is 
used the same logic is applied against the representative details.
 Note
EU VAT IDs use a country prefix concept. For example, DE1234567890 is a German VAT ID.
To determine the destination country (To), SAP Ariba first checks the buying organization’s VAT ID country prefix. If 
that isn’t available, SAP Ariba uses the Ship To address.
If either country is part of the SAP Ariba supported country list, the invoice data will be digitally signed.
At this time most tax authorities do not have the technical and administrative means to verify foreign e-signatures; 
therefore, Ariba Network uses locally compliant e-signatures for countries with stringent requirements, which 
results in two eSignatures if the From and To country fall into this category.

Ariba Network e-signing methods [page 100]
Ariba Network guide to invoicing

Ariba Network e-signing methods
E-signing methods for electronic invoices vary per country.
For a complete list of e-signing methods that Ariba Network suppliers authorize for use in each country, see the 
SAP Ariba e-invoicing reference page .
Ariba Network certLficate details
For authenticity verification, the certificate details such as serial numbers or certificate owner names are available 
for review in the per-country worksheet as part of the TrustWeaver Compliance Map™. See https://
knowledge.ariba.com/Ariba_eSigning_CountryMatrix for more information.
Standard certificate attributes are listed below and can be reviewed per invoice in Ariba:
● Version number of certificate format
● Serial number (unique number from CA)
● Certificate signature algorithm
● Issuer (name of CA)
● Valid-from/valid-to dates
● Subject (name of company or person certified)
● Subject's public key and algorithm
● Digital signature created with CA's private key
Ariba Network certLficate validity period
Each eSignature includes a certificate validity period represented as “Valid From” and “Valid To”. These dates are 
critical at the signing, transmission, and receiving time – once the invoice is archived, the certificate can expire 
because Ariba uses embedded revocation information in the signature format and protects the signature and 
certificate validation steps through separate timestamps. By making the validity of the timestamps long enough 
systems can ensure long-term verifiable evidence of integrity and authenticity of the invoices during the mandatory 
storage period.
In addition, the eSigning service provider used by Ariba will make sure that only valid certificates are used at 
signature time.
Signature authorization validation
Signature authorization validation is required for certain countries, such as Germany. Currently the following 
situation exists:
● All invoices created online and all invoices submitted via CSV, EDI or cXML (without eSignature) will use the 
eSigning service provider’s own certificates.
100 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Digital signature process
● If enabled by the buyer, cXML suppliers can post cXML invoices with eSignatures based on supplier-owned 
certificates (supplier self-signed invoices). Therefore all cXML suppliers must confirm if they use supplierowned certificates or plan to leverage the Ariba Network digital signature solution.
● If the Ariba Network digital signature solution is used, the eSigning service provider validates if the certificate
used was issued by an approved CA for the From and To country as part of the signature verification. For 
supplier self-signed invoices, Ariba Network validates only the integrity of the signature.
As part of the signature validation process, a pre-defined list of “authorized” certificates is used to ensure the 
signature authorization is granted:
● By default all eSigning service provider’s owned certificates are authorized. These certificates are documented 
in the Ariba eSigning Country Matrix at https://knowledge.ariba.com/Ariba_eSigning_CountryMatrix.
● If an invoice is not signed with one of the authorized certificates, the verification fails and the supplier and 
buyer are notified by Ariba Network.
For supplier self-signed invoices, the buyer is responsible to ensure the certificates used by the supplier meet legal 
invoice requirements.
Separation of hardware and service components
As both the signature and signature verification process is performed by Ariba and its 3rd party service provider, a 
clear segregation of duties is required as follows:
● Step IC 04 and IC 06 (refer to the previous diagram) run on the same hardware. In order to make sure that 
these functions are clearly separated, virtually separated software components are used, with separate 
administration and security roles.
● Step IC 07 is performed by a distinct legal entity using completely separate hardware and software 
components (including separate administration of such). The OCSP data response is the key evidence for longterm verification of the invoice.
“On behalf of” supplier to buyer change
Between Step IC 05.1 and IC 05.2 the outsourced “on behalf of” changes from supplier to buyer tasks. The invoice 
creation on behalf of the Supplier is accomplished in IC 05.1. With IC 05.2 the receiving and verification on behalf of 
the Buyer starts.
Invoices with file attachments
Suppliers can add external supporting files (attachments) to invoices, which Ariba Network can route with the 
invoice to the buyer’s invoicing system. Depending on the invoice receiving system, the buyer can choose to store 
these attachments on Ariba Network or have the attachment sent in the HTTPS message as a separate MIME 
message. The attachment will be referenced using the “URL/URI reference.” The URL reference contains a contentid (cid). The cid is a globally unique identifier, usually generated by concatenation of the time and date timestamp 
of the server with the sender host’s domain name, for example, <Attachment><URL>cid:
12346.98765@buyer.ariba.com</URL><Attachment>.

The file attachment itself will not be digitally signed. Please refer to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2111.txt for more 
details.
Self-signed invoices for suppliers
Suppliers can implement their own digital signature solution (using cXML) and create self-signed invoices. Buyers 
must check the rule Allow suppliers to submit self-signed invoices to allow suppliers to submit self-signed 
invoices.
This process assumes that the supplier is the issuer of the invoice, and can also validate on behalf of the buyer. 
Suppliers must use the signature validation method specified for canonicalization as described in the W3C 
specifications before signing the invoice.
Suppliers are free to determine the following using their established business logic for determining when and how 
to apply digital signatures (this may be quite different from the SAP Ariba process):
● Which invoices to sign (in some cases the supplier may choose to not apply a digital signature at all)
● What country combinations of origin and destination to use
● Which certificates to use for signing invoices
Note that if suppliers create self-signed invoices, the suppliers must also provide the human readable invoice copy.
If the invoice is not canonicalized before signing, any third party (for example, Infomosaic, Apache) validation of the 
signature will fail. SAP Ariba’s digital signature feature utilizes TrustWeaver as the third-party eSigning ASP.
 Note
SAP Ariba strongly recommends using Apache for signature validation (and not Microsoft.NET). Refer to 
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n for more information on XML canonicalization.
Requirements for self-signed invoices
Self-signed invoices must conform to the following specifications:
● W3C XML Digital Signature TR specifications
● cXML specification for cXML digital signatures
Validating supplier self-signed invoices
While validating supplier self-signed invoices, Ariba Network only validates that the data content of the cXML 
invoice has not changed since it was signed.
Suppliers who are self-signing invoices are responsible to ensure that
● the certificate used to sign the cXML invoice is valid and not revoked at the time the signature was created.

SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework
The SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework is a general framework used for handling tax invoicing for different
countries.
The SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework includes several modules that can be configured for all supported 
countries:
● The first module is responsible for validating the specific business rules for the configured country.
● The second module is responsible for generating a PDF version of the invoice. This is necessary in case the 
original tax invoice is not in a human-readable format.
● The next module handles the communication with third-party applications used for digitally signing the 
generated PDF invoice. Different countries have their own requirements regarding digital signatures.
● The next module handles the communication with third-party applications used for archiving. Archiving 
requirements also vary from one country to another.
SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework prerequisites
For Buyers
Buyers must add and activate the Country-based Invoice Rules for at least one country where SAP Ariba supports 
tax invoicing.
For Suppliers
Suppliers must have a trading relationship with at least one buyer who has added and activated the Country-based 
Invoice Rules for at least one country where SAP Ariba supports tax invoicing.

The following diagram illustrates the SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework workflow:
Figure 12: SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework workflow
The following is a step-by-step description of the workflow for the SAP Ariba tax invoicing framework:
1. A buyer and supplier have a trading relationship on the Ariba Network.
2. The buyer has added the country-based invoicing rules for a country supported in the SAP Ariba tax invoicing 
framework.
3. A tax invoice issued in the same country is sent from the supplier to the buyer. The invoice is sent via the Ariba 
Network or through cXML .
4. The invoice, in cXML format, is received and processed by the SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework.
5. The invoice is validated based on the customer's business configurations for the country, where it is issued.
6. The invoice is digitally signed. Digital signatures vary from one country to another.
 Note
If the invoice is received from an integrated ERP system and is signed outside of the Ariba Network, the 
digital signature is verified and a verification report is generated.
7. A human-readable version of the invoice in PDF format is generated in case one is not available.

Tax invoicing in Brazil
Tax invoicing in Brazil provides an electronic invoicing solution that includes receiving, validating, transforming, and 
transmitting tax invoices to buying organizations through Ariba Network.
Brazilian tax authority known as Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ) mandates legal compliance on all the commercial 
transactions between the suppliers and buyers. SEFAZ also mandates the use of a defined electronic standard 
invoice known as Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (NFe) to standardize the transaction document used between the tax 
authority and the tax payers (suppliers and buyers). NFe is considered as an indispensable legal document 
necessary for all business enterprises to implement and accomplish legal compliance on all their commercial 
transactions.
Though NFe is the official electronic invoice of Brazil there are few other types of invoices such as Conhecimento de 
Transporte (CTe), Carta de Correção Eletrônica (CCe), Documento Auxiliar do Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (DANFe), and 
Documento Auxiliar do Conhecimento de Transporte (DACTe) used for different business transactions.
Table 1: Types of electronic invoices for Brazil:
Invoice Name Invoice Type Description
Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (NFe)
Electronic Invoice An electronic invoice issued and stored electronically for tax purposes. The 
legal validity of the document is determined by the digital signature of the 
sender and the authorization receipt by the tax authorities.
Conhecimento de 
Transporte (CTe)
Electronic Freight invoice An electronic freight invoice issued and stored electronically for all the transportation-related services for the invoiced items. The legal validity of the 
document is determined by the digital signature of the sender and the authorization receipt by the tax authorities.

The following diagram is a high level illustration of the Brazilian electronic invoicing process:
Figure 13: High-level Brazilian electronic invoicing process
1. Supplier sends the signed NFe to SEFAZ for legal validation.
2. SEFAZ validates the document and sends it back to the supplier. Supplier generates DANFe (pdf version of 
NFe) along with the embedded approval code received from SEFAZ.
3. Supplier sends the legally authorized invoice to the buyer.
○ NFe which is an electronic invoice, is sent to the buyer through email or HTTPS.
○ For physical goods, DANFe is printed and placed on the carrier truck.
4. Buyer receives the invoice and validates the SEFAZ authorization on the invoice on the SEFAZ website.
 Note
To test the invoice flow in test environments using production invoices, Ariba Network provides an option to 
validate these invoices against the Production SEFAZ service. Buyers are now provided an option to test the 
production invoices against the Production SEFAZ service using their test accounts on Ariba Network. This 
option is provided because invoices may have their data changed or corrupted in test scenarios because of 
end to end testing. As a result, these invoices may fail SEFAZ validation. To enable this option that is 
available only in test environments, sign in to Ariba Network Administration, click the Buyer tab, navigate 
to the User Detail - Buyer Information page, and check the Skip SEFAZ validation? box.

Brazil tax invoicing process on Ariba Network
The following diagram illustrates electronic invoicing workflow for Brazil in detail:
Figure 14: Brazil tax invoicing workflow process
The following steps describe the workflow of the electronic invoicing process for Brazil in detail:
1. The supplier user creates and generates electronic invoices such as NFe or CTe from their electronic invoicing 
solution and uses the private key number issued by the government to sign the invoice.
 Note
Brazilian suppliers use their ERP systems to create invoices and not Ariba Network’s electronic invoicing 
solutions. The invoice issued from the suppliers ERP system is sent to SEFAZ for automatic checking 
before sending to Ariba Network for authorization process. The generated invoice is considered valid and 
legal only after the automatic checking on the SEFAZ website.
2. The signed XML invoice document is sent to the Ariba Network through email or HTTPS. If the invoice sent by 
the supplier is not in the XML format, Ariba Network rejects the invoice and an email is sent to notify the 
supplier about the format error. An invoice in the correct format is processed further.
 Note
Ariba Network accepts only XML- based invoices.
3. Ariba Network receives the invoice and checks if the invoice contains valid legal fields and an electronic 
signature. If yes, Ariba Network transforms the invoice to required invoice format and generates the PDF 
versions of NFe and CTe as DANFe and DACTe respectively.
4. Ariba Network performs data validation on the transformed NFe invoice. The data validation includes checking 
of details such as PO Number, PO Line Item Number, Freight Charges. If the validation is successful, the invoice 
is processed further; else the invoice is rejected.
5. The transformed NFe invoice with electronic signature is sent to SEFAZ for SEFAZ validation on the NFe invoice.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 109
6. SEFAZ receives the invoice and validates the invoice document based on the legal parameters such as 
electronic signature, CNPJ number, and assigns an approval code on the document. SEFAZ returns the 
authorized document back to Ariba Network through an accredited web service.
7. Ariba Network receives the SEFAZ response and stores it. If SEFAZ validation fails, the invoice is not processed 
further.
8. Ariba Network processes the successfully validated invoice to the buyer’s system. The buyer receives and 
processes the invoices. The appropriate invoice response is sent to the Ariba Network and the invoice status is 
updated accordingly.
 Note
● DANFe and DACTe are used during the shipment of physical goods. The printed version of the document 
with embedded approval code is placed on the truck with the shipment.
● If a supplier want to cancel an NFe, the supplier user must initiate the cancellation process within 24 hours 
of invoice submission by creating and submitting a new NFe (invoice).
● If a supplier wants to add, modify, and update an invoice, the supplier user can send a letter detailing the 
required modifications and update on the submitted invoice. The letter containing additional details of the 
invoice is known as CCe (Invoice Addendum).
● Ensure to refer the CCe (Invoice Addendum) document with its corresponding invoice number (NFe). For 
example, if the NFe invoice number is xx, the CCe document must refer the NFe invoice number xx in the 
document to successfully process the CCe document through Ariba Network. If the CCe document does 
not match its corresponding NFe, the document is rejected by Ariba Network.
● Suppliers send CCe to SEFAZ website for automatic checking. However, when Ariba Network receives the 
CCe document from SEFAZ it is not validated by SEFAZ. SEFAZ validation is mandatory only for NFe and 
CTe.

1otLficatLons for Brazilian tax invoices
The Ariba Network sends an email notification to the suppliers for the following scenarios:
● When the digital certificate is about to expire.
● When the digital certificate has expired.
● When the municipality delays the issuance of NFS-e invoice, the Ariba Network sends an email to the buyer 
indicating the delay and attaches RPS document as an interim invoice document.
Suppliers can enable notification of certificate expiration in the Contact Details section of the Set Up Legal Profile
page or in the NotLficatLons section of the Electronic Order Routing page.
 Note
If you have enabled notification for digital certificate expiration in the Contact Details section, the notification

Tax invoicing in Mexico
Tax invoicing in Mexico provides an electronic invoicing solution that includes receiving, validating, transforming, 
and transmitting tax invoices to buying organizations through Ariba Network.
The tax authority of Mexico, known as Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT) mandates companies to use the 
SAT-authorized electronic invoicing process for all domestic commercial transactions. SAT also mandates the use 
of a defined XML invoice format known as Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) as the only acceptable 
invoice document format. With the SAT-authorized electronic invoicing process in Mexico, it is mandatory for 
suppliers in Mexico to have an accredited e-invoicing solution provider to create and generate invoices and an 
organization that facilitates in providing authorized digital signatures required for the invoices. These organizations 
are called Proveedor Autorizado de Certificaci´n (PACs).
 Note
Electronic invoicing regulations in Mexico do not apply to cross-border invoices.
Mexican suppliers can submit invoices in Mexico through manual upload of a CFDI invoice (that was cleared in the 
suppliers' ERP or their other in-house systems) using a wizard in Ariba Network. For more information, see How to 
upload CFDI and PDF invoices [page 113].
Ariba Network converts the uploaded invoice into cXML and validates it against an authorized service. Buyers can 
receive the invoice with the electronic stamped CFDI and a PDF version that are available on the supplier’s Ariba 
Network account. Suppliers then send it to the buyer’s system through Ariba Network after passing all the business 
validations set by each buyer.

in compliance with SAT catalogue: c_UsoCFDI
Classification (domain="GTIN") The product/service code must be added at item level in compliance with SAT catalogue: c_ClaveProdServ (GTIN domain). SAP Ariba validates that it is an 8-digit code and PAC 
validates that is valid code. Ideally, purchase orders should include this value according to the SAT catalogue, so that suppliers do not have to enter this information.
Unit of Measure (UOM) This value must follow the SAT catalogue: c_ClaveUnidad. 
Ideally, purchase orders should include this value (For example: “EA” for each, “H87” for piece, among others). If purchase 
orders do not include this value, suppliers must modify the 
UOM accordingly. Otherwise, their invoices will be rejected by 
SAP Ariba’s PAC.
In addition, the cXML invoice document for Mexico contains the following element:

Localization of the cXML is required (through extrinsic fields, for example, to be delivered by SAP Ariba integration 
teams) to capture this additional information and automatically load it into the buyer´s ERP system for tax 
purposes.

Addenda
Addenda is an open section within the structured CFDI for suppliers to insert additional information.
SAP Ariba has designed its own Addenda to standardize and facilitate the exchange of information between 
different buyers and suppliers. By using addenda information, suppliers can upload their CFDI invoices with all the 
business references required by their buyers, bypassing the need of manual entry in Ariba Network.
The chosen structure is simple and easy for suppliers to adopt because it contains the minimum additional 
information required by buyers to process their invoices, automate internal processes, and reduce processing 
times.
The required data are business references that allow linking a CFDI invoice with its supporting documents traded 
on the SAP Ariba platform to ensure compliance with buyer requirements.
● Business references at header level: purchase orders, service entry sheets, goods receipt notes, sales orders, 
internal references, contracts.
● Line item number at line level
How to upload CFDI and PDF invoices
Context
Suppliers in Ariba Network must upload their digitally signed CFDI invoices using the following steps from their 
Ariba Network accounts. The corresponding PDF versions of the CFDI invoices must also be uploaded; however, 
suppliers can choose to upload their own PDFs or the PDF generated by EDICOM, SAP Ariba's authorized service 
partner.
Procedure
1. Log in to your Ariba Network supplier account.
2. Go to External Document > Document.
3. Browse and upload a CFDI document.
4. Legal Validations: In the first step of the CFDI upload process, Ariba Network checks for errors in the CFDI 
document. If no errors are found during the validation, you can proceed to the next step. However, if the CFDI 
document validation fails, you must correct the errors and upload the document again.

purchase order number, service entry sheet number, goods receipt note number, sales note, contract or 
internal reference, service delivery start and end dates, sales order number, and so on. Ariba Network guides 
your inputs by providing relevant error messages.
7. Submit Documents: In this page, you can perform a final review of your inputs and submit your documents.
8. Business validations: After the documents are submitted, they are validated against the set of business rules 
configured by the corresponding buyer. Suppliers can see the final status in their Outbox on Ariba Network.
Support for payment receipts (Complemento de Pago)
Mexico: support for payment receipts (Complemento de Pago)
Ariba Network extends support for payment receipts (known as Complemento de Pago in Mexico) submitted by 
suppliers. This is a document type defined by the Mexican Tax Authority (SAT).
Payment receipts must be issued by suppliers in Mexico when they receive part payments or payments in full from 
their buyers. This is an effort by tax authorities to avoid inappropriate cancellations of invoices by suppliers. This 
mandatory ruling came into effect on August 31, 2018. The new document type format is CFDI.
Mexican suppliers can now submit payment receipts in Mexico in the following forms:
● Post a payment receipt and the corresponding PDF (optional) to Ariba Network.
● Manually upload CFDI payment receipt and the corresponding PDF (that were probably created in the 
suppliers' ERP or other inhouse systems) using a wizard in Ariba Network.
Prerequisites and restrictions
● Supplier VAT ID in the payment receipt must match Supplier VAT ID configured in Ariba Network for the logged 
in organization.
● Buyer VAT ID in the payment receipt must match VAT ID configured by buyer in Ariba Network.
● Supplier and buyer must have an active trading relationship for which the payment receipt is being uploaded.
● Uploaded payment receipt must be digitally signed by SAT. Unsigned documents are rejected.
● Payment receipt documents are not converted to cXML. The uploaded payment receipt document and 
associated PDF are mailed to the buyer.

Tax invoicing in Chile
Tax invoicing for Chile provides electronic invoicing solution which includes receiving, validating, transforming and 
transmitting tax invoices to the buying organizations through the Ariba Network.
The Ariba Network supports the XML format for Chilean e-invoicing, DTE (electronic tax document) mandated by 
the Chilean tax authority (Servicio de Impuestos Internos, or SII). When suppliers create a Chilean tax invoice on 
the Ariba Network, the Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework automatically converts it from cXML to DTE before sending it 
to the authorized service provider for digital signature. When suppliers create a Chilean tax invoice using an 
integrated service provider, the service provider sends a signed DTE invoice to the Ariba Network.
Tax invoicing for Chile supports the following:
● Country-based invoice rules and required fields
● Receiving, sending, and transforming DTE XML invoices
● Chilean e-signing process
Ariba Network supports the following Chilean invoice types:
Type of invoice Supported Chilean invoice types
Material goods invoice ● Tax Invoice (Type Code = 33)
● Tax Exempt Invoice (Type Code = 34)
● Line Item Credit Memo (Type Code = 61)
Service invoice ● Tax Invoice (Type Code = 33)
● Tax Exempt Invoice (Type Code = 34)
 Note
Chilean suppliers do not need to have an existing trading relationship with an Ariba Network buyer to submit a 
Chilean tax invoice to the buyer. If the supplier does not have a trading relationship with the buyer when the 
Chilean tax invoice is received, the Ariba Network sets one up automatically.

Figure 15: Workflow for creating Chilean tax invoices using an integrated service provider
The following steps describe the workflow process of a supplier who creates a Chilean tax invoice on a service 
provider’s portal or generates a Chilean tax invoice from their accounting system:
1. A supplier’s accounting system submits a DTE invoice to a SII-accredited service provider (for example, 
Signature). Alternatively, the service provider may send the DTE invoice directly to Ariba Network on behalf of 
the supplier.
2. The service provider verifies that the DTE invoice complies with all established regulations. It generates a PDF 
version of the invoice and stores the documents, including a history log and ACK messages, according to 
country rules.
1. The service provider reports the DTE invoice to the tax authority of Chile (SII).
2. The service provider submits the digitally-signed DTE invoice and the PDF to Ariba Network.
3. The SAP Ariba Tax Invoicing Framework validates the DTE invoice according to SII guidelines, ensuring that it 
conforms to the DTE XML DTD. If it is a valid DTE invoice, the framework transforms the invoice to cXML.
4. Ariba Network sends the cXML invoice to the buyer. Attached to the invoice are the original digitally-signed DTE 
invoice and its associated PDF.

External tax invoice handling
An external tax invoice is any tax invoice in electronic format that is not created online in Ariba Network. External 
tax invoice handling allows buyers to apply a specific set of Ariba Network transaction rules to all external tax 
invoices irrespective of the supplier that is referenced in the invoice. This set of configurable transaction rules is 
called External Tax Invoice Rules. The configured external tax invoice rules are applied only to external electronic 
tax invoices.
To prevent automatic invoice field validations, buyers typically would like to have less stringent rules for external tax 
invoices than for regular invoices.
● Buyers are given the option to configure a set of invoice rules to be applied to all external tax invoices.
● Buyers can configure transaction rules for external tax invoices by creating supplier groups and configuring
appropriate rules for such groups.
The following table summarizes what Ariba Network does with external tax invoices and regular invoices when a 
buyer account has external tax invoice rules configured.
Invoice Scenario Supplier Is in a Supplier Group Ariba Network Action
Any external tax invoice Does not matter Applies external tax invoice rules
Regular invoice created in Ariba Network Yes Applies group-specific transaction rules
No Applies default transaction rules
Workflow for external tax invoice handling
When a buyer's account in Ariba Network is configured to use external tax invoice rules:
1. Buyer administrators configure external tax invoice rules. These rules are a subset of default transaction rules.
2. Suppliers send an external tax invoice to Ariba Network from their ERP systems or through their service 
provider.
3. Ariba Network receives the external tax invoice invoice and applies external tax invoice rules.
How to confiJure transaction rules for external tax invoices
Context
You can create a general set of transaction rules that apply to all external tax invoices regardless of other custom 
transaction rules (for example, country-specific rules).

Tax invoicing in Hungary
Tax invoicing in Hungary provides an electronic invoicing solution that includes receiving, validating, transforming, 
and transmitting tax invoices to buying organizations through Ariba Network.
Tax invoicing in Hungary requires suppliers to maintain a range of invoice numbers in accordance with the 
directives of the Hungarian tax authorities. In addition, tax regulations in Hungary require suppliers to present tax 
invoice reports for auditing purposes.
From July 1, 2018, suppliers in Hungary must report all invoices that exceed a VAT of 100,000 Hungarian Forint 
(HUF) to the Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration (NAV). This is a mandatory tax regulation 
initiated by the NAV in Hungary. The NAV is an online system. The invoicing system used by suppliers to create 
invoices (Ariba Network), must report such invoices online to the NAV immediately after the invoices are issued. 
Keeping in line with this tax requirement, invoices issued by suppliers in Hungary are reported to the NAV through 
the Ariba Network interface.
Ariba Network does not report invoices with VAT less than 100,000 HUF to the NAV. However, there is no regulation 
that discourages reporting invoices with less than or equal to 100,000 HUF.
This is applicable only to domestic invoices, where suppliers and buyers (or their tax representatives) are located in 
Hungary. This regulation makes it compulsory to report only mandatory invoice fields to the NAV.
The National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary introduced version 1.1 of the format supported by the 
online invoicing system. This version is effective from May 02, 2019. For more information see Schema update 
version 1.1 [page 121].
Salient features
The salient features in Ariba Network to tax invoicing in Hungary are listed below:
● Hungarian suppliers can create a tax profile with details of:
○ Locations
○ Associated Tax and VAT IDs
○ Folio ranges with numbers that are associated with each invoice
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 119
● Hungarian buyers can provide their Tax IDs and intra-EU VAT IDs in their Ariba Network profiles.
● Tax Determination Date - Suppliers can specify this date on the invoice header. This is the date from which tax 
is due. The date can be a past or a future date, and is mandatory. If this field is not populated, the invoice date 
is considered for the tax invoice report.
● Tax invoice number association - An invoice that is received by or created in Ariba Network is assigned a tax 
invoice number from an active folio range.
● Sending tax invoices to TrustWeaver for electronic signing. The signed invoices are then propagated to buyers.
● Hungarian suppliers can download tax invoice summary reports for auditing purposes.
Prerequisites for suppliers
● Hungarian suppliers must configure their SAP Ariba accounts before they can submit tax invoices.
● Users must be logged in as administrator to make configuration changes.
● Before creating invoices, Hungarian suppliers must specify the supplier's country of origin as Hungary on the 
Company Profile page of their SAP Ariba account.
● Supplier organizations must register at the NAV portal and generate their Technical User ID, Password, 
Signature Key, and Replacement Key and provide these details in their Ariba Network user accounts.
● If supplier organizations do not have their VAT ID, they must enter the tax ID of their tax representative in the 
regulatory profile section.
Prerequisites for buyers
● Users must be logged in as administrator to make configuration changes.
● The buyer administer must enable the following five Hungary specific country based rules:
○ Require tax amounts in local currency.
○ Require subtotal and amount due in local currency.
○ Determine local currency based on supplier country.
○ Require detailed tax information in tax summaries.
○ Require suppliers to choose from your list of valid tax values.
 Note
If any of the preceding five Hungary specific country based rules are unchecked, Ariba Network may fail to 
report invoices with VAT exceeding 100,000 HUF to NAV, and may result in gaps in the folio number 
sequence.
Information about Ariba Network invoicing software
Hungarian suppliers using Ariba Network to create invoices in Ariba Network may need the following information. 
However, there is no general registration requirement for Ariba Network or for suppliers using Ariba Network.

Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process
● Software name: Ariba Network
● Software ID: SAPARIBA-AN-201807
● Developer name: SAP SE
● Developer VAT ID: DE 143454214
● Name of the seller: (for example) SAP Hungary Ltd.
● VAT ID of the seller: (for example) 12342659-2-44
● System name: SAPARIBA-AN-201807
● System accessibility: https://service.ariba.com/Supplier.aw
Limitations
● The report can be downloaded only for a period of three months at a time. This means that if a report is 
required for a year, the supplier must download four reports – one for each quarter.
● When suppliers use the Ariba Network for invoicing in Hungary, they must ensure that the same invoice 
content is not reported from another invoicing system (e. g. supplier ERP system). Otherwise, there is a risk of 
duplication of invoice data at the NAV.
● Only invoices and line item credit memos are reported to the NAV through the Ariba Network interface.
● Supplier organizations are not allowed to create invoices that have a VAT of more than 100,000 HUF if the 
supplier organization has not registered at the NAV portal:
Schema update version 1.1
Improved data reporting to NAV
NAV has introduced an updated version of the schema for NAV reporting, Version 1.1. NAV will continue to accept 
the current XML electronic invoice version 1.0 till April 30, 2019. From May 01, 2019 NAV accepts electronic 
invoices only in version 1.1. The new XSD schema and the latest specification document are available at https://
onlineszamla-test.nav.gov.hu/.Ariba Network has effected the required changes in its software to ensure the usage 
of the new schema introduced by NAV in Hungary.
The following table describes the scope of the current feature:
Table 4: Scope of Hungary schema update v1.1
Backward compatibility The new XSD schema and the latest specification document are available at https://onlineszamlatest.nav.gov.hu/ . If an invoice has been reported to NAV with version 1.0, the invoice can be 
modified (corrected) using version 1.1 of the NAV schema. However, the converse is not true. In 
other words, if an invoice has been reported to NAV in version 1.1, the invoice cannot be modified
using version 1.0.
Request version The requestVersion tag will include version 1.1 instead of version 1.0 with the introduction of 
the new schema.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 121
Valid VAT rate percentages
NAV mandates that only the following VAT rates are valid and authorized in Hungary: 5%, 7%, 
12%, 18%, 20%, 25%, and 27%. However, for goods and services that are exempt from VAT, suppliers must enter 0% as the VAT rate. If suppliers use a VAT rate that is not part of this NAV-authorized list, their invoices will fail when they are reported to NAV. In addition, suppliers will lose 
the system-generated invoice number (also called folio number).
● If VAT rate is non-zero, suppliers must not select any value for the Exempt Detail field in Ariba 
Network.
● If VAT rate is zero, suppliers must select ‘Exempt’ from the Exempt Detail drop-down menu.
 Note
Buyers must ensure that they configure the list of valid VAT rates for their suppliers to choose 
from. If buyers do not do so, their suppliers' invoices might fail at NAV because of invalid VAT 
rates.
Tax determination date Suppliers must specify this date on the invoice header. This is the date from which tax is due. The 
date can be a past or a future date, and is mandatory. However, if it is a past date, it cannot precede January 01, 2010.
 Note
If this field is not populated, the invoice date is considered for the tax invoice report.
Mandatory currency exchange rate
● If the invoice currency is Hungarian Forint (HUF), Ariba Network populates 1 as the exchange 
rate value in the report.
● If the invoice currency is not HUF, then Ariba Network reports the value of the taxExchangeRate extrinsic in the invoice cXML document. If the invoice cXML document does not contain 
the taxExchangeRate extrinsic value, then Ariba Network calculates the exchange rate by dividing the alternate total tax amount by the total tax amount.
Mandatory line level description
If suppliers have their legal profile configured, a description of the product or service at the invoice 
line level is now mandatory while creating a tax invoice.
Unit of Measure values If the cXML invoice element unitOfMeasure contains any of these values: PIECE, KILOGRAM, TON, 
KWH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, MONTH, LITER, KILOMETER, CUBIC_METER, METER, LINEAR_METER, CARTON, or PACK, the report sent to NAV contains the translated values exactly. Otherwise, 
in the report sent to NAV, Ariba Network replaces the cXML invoice element unitOfMeasure with 
the OWN cXML invoice element and also includes the unitOfMeasureOWN cXML element containing the value specified by the supplier.
Warning messages When invoice data reported to NAV does not meet the required guidelines, NAV issues warning 
and error messages depending on the severity of the error. With version 1.1 of the NAV reporting 
schema, NAV has introduced a few new warning messages. A few existing warning messages have 
also been updated for greater clarity. These warning messages will be displayed in the History tab 
of the invoice in Ariba Network.
Unique line item number 
reference
While creating line item credit memos, integrated suppliers must ensure that the line item number 
reference is unique.
Correction and storno invoices
In Hungary, the correction invoice option allows you to create correction invoices for products or services that were 
previously invoiced, but need amendments. The need for amendments may arise as a result of incorrect 
122 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process
information provided in the original invoice, or because of changes that have occurred to the quantities, prices or 
tax amounts.
When you make a correction to a previous invoice or if you reverse (storno) it, according to legal regulations, you 
must create a correction invoice or reversal invoice depending on the type of change.
Correction invoice: A correction invoice is issued when a previously issued invoice needs to be corrected. The 
corrections may be needed to change the item quantity, tax amount, and so on. A correction invoice in Hungary 
contains:
● Correction Invoice as the invoice header label (title). This label appears on the cXML, online (Ariba Network 
UI), and PDF versions of invoices.
● reference to the original invoice that is being corrected. Ariba Network auto-populates this information in the 
correction invoice.
● the corrected amount with a negative sign.
● the new invoice item.
● the difference between the data in the original invoice and the correction invoice.
 Note
Correction and storno invoices are reported to the NAV even if the VAT amount is less than or equal to 100000 
HUF.
Storno invoice: A storno invoice is created when
● goods (or services) in an original invoice were not provided.
● an invoice is issued to a customer other than the intended customer.
● all the line item quantities in an invoice are set to zero (because of corrections).
A storno invoice in Hungary contains:
● Storno Invoice as the invoice header label (title). This label appears on the cXML, online (Ariba Network UI), 
and PDF versions of invoices.
● reference to the original invoice. Ariba Network auto-populates this information in the storno invoice.
● the corrected amount with a negative sign.
Technical annulment of NAV invoices in Hungary
Suppliers in Hungary can annul an invoice from the Ariba Network. Suppliers can annul invoices that were 
incorrectly reported to NAV (and were subsequently rejected or failed in Ariba Network) by using an option in Ariba 
Network. Annulled invoices cannot be edited, or re-submitted to NAV. For information on how to annul an invoice, 
see How to annul an invoice [page 127].
How to set up a regulatory profile for Hungarian suppliers
Context
Regulatory profiles refer to supplier accounts registered with the tax authorities in Hungary for electronic invoicing 
procedures. Suppliers in Hungary can have multiple VAT IDs. However, one VAT ID can have only one regulatory 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 123
profile associated with it. The Set Up Legal Profile check box is available to suppliers in Hungary. Ariba Network 
displays the Set Up Legal Profile check box only if you have selected the Country as Hungary.
 Note
All the existing (legacy) regulatory profiles associated with a supplier's VAT ID are migrated to the Legal Profile
page. When you create the first regulatory profile, you will be asked to confirm if you wish to migrate your 
existing regulatory profiles. The current enhancement facilitates the creation of new regulatory profiles in Ariba 
Network.
Procedure
1. Click Company Settings Company Profile .
2. Go to Additional Company Addresses section and click Create to configure additional supplier addresses.
3. Enter the following required fields in the Address Name section :
○ Address Name - Supplier's company address
○ VAT ID - Supplier's VAT ID
○ Tax ID
Supplier VAT ID can contain a maximum of 20 digits. It must begin with HU, and must be followed by a 
minimum of 8 digits.
Tax ID is an 8-digit numeric value. You cannot have same Tax ID for different supplier profiles.
4. Enter the following required fields in the Address section:
○ Address 2 - Your company's additional branch address in Hungary.
○ Postal Code - This is a four digit number.
○ Country
5. Select the Set Up Legal Profile check box.
Results
The regulatory profile for the VAT ID is created, and suppliers can now set up tax invoice number ranges for this 
regulatory profile. After a standard invoice or line item credit memo is submitted, Ariba Network processes these 
invoices sequentially and assigns a folio number that is configured in the regulatory profile. This number is 
captured in the taxInvoiceNumber extrinsic. The document is then sent to TrustWeaver for digital signing.
How to set up a tax invoice number range
Context
A tax invoice number range (also called a folio) is a range of numbers that a supplier defines in Ariba Network. 
When a standard tax invoice is created, Ariba Network automatically assigns a number sequentially from the active 
124 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process
range to the invoice. Note that even though you can have multiple tax invoice number ranges defined, only one 
range can be active at any time.
To create a tax invoice number range:
Procedure
1. In the Financial Information section, select Standard Invoice or Line Item Credit Memo depending on the 
invoice type you want to create.
2. Click Create.
3. Enter your choice of numbers in the Initial Tax Invoice Number and Final Tax Invoice Number fields.
4. If you want to make this the active tax invoice number range, click Activate.
The Legal Profile Status column displays the registration status with SAP Ariba's accredited service provider.
5. Click Save.
A tax invoice number range already in use cannot be deleted.
How to register NAV information

How to opt out of tax invoicing in Hungary
Context
Suppliers in Hungary who wish to report their invoices to the NAV only through their ERP systems (or other inhouse systems) can choose to opt out of tax reporting using Ariba Network. In such cases, invoices issued by 
suppliers are proforma invoices. Proforma invoices are abridged or estimated invoices that contain only essential 
information for buyers, and cannot be considered as a request for payment. Ariba Network provides a check box to 
allow suppliers to opt out of NAV reporting. To opt out of NAV reporting, follow these steps:
Procedure
1. Click Company Settings Electronic Invoice Routing Tax Invoicing and Archiving .
2. Scroll down to Tax Invoicing for Hungary.
3. Select the box Disable Tax Invoicing for Hungary.
When you check this box, your invoices will not be reported to the NAV, and will therefore not represent a tax 
invoice according to the tax regulations in Hungary. Invoices created in Ariba Network after you check this box 
will be considered proforma invoices. Proforma invoices are abridged or estimated invoices that contain only 
essential information for buyers, and cannot be considered as a request for payment.
4. Click Save.

French parafiscal taxes
Parafiscal taxes are specific taxes used in France and enforced by French law.
The idea of the parafiscal taxes is to create dedicated funds for different causes. When selling particular products, 
French sellers are obliged to collect parafiscal taxes for specific purposes, which they ultimately pay to a third party, 
responsible for investing the funds according to their purpose. For example, if a customer buys a polluting product 
from a French seller, then this customer has to pay an environment tax.
Ariba Network allows French suppliers to add parafiscal taxes on both line and header level. Parafisal taxes can be 
added to non-PO invoices and credit memos. Furthermore, as parafiscal taxes are subject to VAT taxes, Ariba 
Network suppliers can add a VAT tax to parafiscal taxes.
Prerequisites for entering French parafiscal taxes on invoices
To allow their suppliers to use French parafiscal taxes on invoices, buyers must do the following:
● Check the Allow suppliers to add allowances and charges to invoices rule located on the Default 
Transaction Rules page.
● Activate the Country-based Invoice Rules for France and check the rule Allow suppliers to include parafiscal
taxes.
● Uncheck the Ignore country-based invoice rules rule located on the Default Transaction Rules page.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 131
French parafiscal taxes process on the Ariba Network
The following general steps describe the workflow for including parafiscal taxes in French invoices:
1. A supplier creates an invoice.
2. The supplier's default address is French or the supplier updates the address on the invoice to a French address.
 Note
Parafiscal taxes can only be added to invoices if the supplier address is French.
3. The supplier adds a charge to the header or to a line item.
4. The supplier selects Parafiscal Tax from the list of available charges and fills in the necessary information for 
the parafiscal tax. Optionally, the supplier adds a VAT tax to the parafiscal tax.
5. The supplier completes and sends the invoice.
6. The buyer receives the invoice and views the parafiscal tax information.
French tax invoicing audit reports
Audit reports in France for buyers and suppliers exchanging invoices electronically.
Ariba Network provides audit reports for French buyers and French suppliers who exchange invoices electronically. 
Summary List and Partner File reports are commonly used by French organizations to facilitate the tax invoicing 
process. The reports are required by French tax authorities when trading partners use the EDI method of 
exchanging invoices according to Article 289 3° of the French General Tax Code. Otherwise, the default method 
used by SAP Ariba is the digital signature according to Article 289 2° of the French General Tax Code. The Ariba 
Network generates the reports automatically regardless of the methods used.
The reports are fiscal objects, which provide information about the French tax invoices, exchanged between trading 
partners. They are maintained per VAT ID and they are generated automatically in the Ariba Network. If a buyer or a 
supplier user has more than one VAT ID, several reports are generated for them - one for each VAT ID. Every VAT ID 
is associated with one or more addresses. Buyers and suppliers on the Ariba Network can add as many addresses 
and VAT IDs, as they need. They can also enter unique names for each address, so they can easily differentiate
between them. Each VAT ID, together with its address(es) and address name is considered a single legal entity. The 
header of each French Summary List and Partner File report contains information about the legal entity, for which it 
has been generated. This legal entity is the report owner.
Both the French Summary List and the Partner File reports are generated in PDF format and they are digitally 
signed and archived. The signed PDF files, together with signature verification files, are sent to the SAP Ariba LongTerm Document Archiving service for the corresponding buyer and supplier. Archived reports can be accessed on 
the Document Archive page. The retention time of the reports in the Document Archive depends on the time, set 
for France in the SAP Ariba Tax Archiving Framework. To check the retention time for France, go to the Ariba Terms 
Center , click Country Coverage under Terms and Policies for Services, and find the Retention Period for 
France.
The French Summary List and Partner File reports are used for auditing purposes and they are required by French 
tax authorities when the EDI method of exchanging invoices is used. The reports are checked together by tax 
auditors. The French Partner File report helps tax inspectors view all trading partners of an organization. From 
auditing perspective each legal entity is considered a single trading partner. The French Summary List reports

French Summary List report
The French Summary List report lists all invoices processed by SAP Ariba for a buyer or supplier legal entity 
registered for VAT in France for a given day. Reports are generated every day and they contain all invoices 
transacted on the previous day. If no invoices were sent or received by the legal entity for a given day, no report is 
generated. Each report file can contain up to 1,000 invoices. If more than 1,000 invoices are transacted on a given 
day, the contents of the report are split into multiple files.
Each French Summary List report contains a header and a body in a table format. The header contains the legal 
entity information of the report owner, including the owner's role - buyer or supplier. The body contains a table 
listing all invoices that have been received or sent by the report owner, depending on the role. Each row from the 
table contains information for a single invoice, like the invoice number, the date when it was issued and the total 
amount of the invoice. For more information about the contents, see Contents of the French Summary List Report 
[page 133].

French Partner File report
The French Partner File report lists all electronic invoicing relationships that exist between the report owner and all 
trading partners of the owner. Each Partner File report is generated once and then regenerated when an update on 
its contents is required. The updating process is done simultaneously for the buyers and suppliers who are 
involved. A new file is created whenever a trading relationship is created or ended. Updates can also be triggered 
when buyer or supplier legal entity information is changed. For example, if the buyer address is changed, a new 
Partner File report is generated for all legal entities that are impacted. Each report file can contain up to 1,000 
trading partners. If the report owner has more than 1,000 trading partners, the contents of the report are split into 
multiple files.
Each Partner File report contains a header and a body in a table format. The header contains the legal entity 
information of the report owner, including the name, address, VAT ID and role - buyer or supplier. The body 
contains a table listing all current trading relationships of the report owner. Each row from the table contains 
134 C O N F I D E N T I A L

End date in French Partner file report
This Ariba Network feature is applicable to French buyers and French suppliers who exchange invoices 
electronically. An end date in the French partner file report is populated when a trading relationship is ended or 
when a legal entity information (name, address, VAT ID) is modified or deleted.
When a new trading relationship is created, or when a closed relationship is reopened, Ariba Network does not 
generate a report.
A report with a new start date is generated only after the first invoice From or To a trading partner has been 
processed.
Populating end date in the partner file report occurs in any of the following cases:
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process C O N F I D E N T I A L 135
● Buyer edits/deletes their Sold To address
● Supplier edits/deletes their From address
● There is a closure of trading relationship on Ariba Network
Each Partner File report is generated once and then regenerated when an update on its contents is required. The 
updating process is done simultaneously for the buyers and suppliers who are involved.
Report owner is the legal entity in the header section of the Partner File report. The header is the title which 
contains the legal entity name, address, VAT ID, the role of the report owner – buyer or supplier, and the date of 
creation of the report.
Trading partner of the owner is the legal entity in the body of the Partner File report. The body is a table which 
contains information about all trading relationships of the report owner up to the date when the report was 
generated.
The following table explains cases of Partner File report generation:

closed trading relationship.
A new partner file is generated with a 
start date only for the trading partner to 
whom the invoice is sent to. Report 
header contains the new data of the legal entity.
The partner file is regenerated with a 
new entry for the new legal entity with 
start date and all other previous records.

not be triggered by changes to only the Address ID and/or Tax ID fields.
ConfiJurLnJ French legal entities
You can configure French legal entities for your Ariba Network account in the following ways:
● Add them manually by associating your company addresses with VAT IDs.
Buyers do this by creating Sold To addresses. Suppliers do this by creating Additional Addresses.
● Create them automatically from information contained in invoices.
If a successfully transacted invoice contains a French address that does not coincide with the already existing 
addresses of the corresponding buyer or supplier, the Ariba Network adds it as a new legal entity in the system 
database.

 Note
Legal entities that are created automatically cannot be viewed or edited through the user interface. They are 
used solely for creating French Summary List and Partner File reports. It is the user's responsibility to make 
sure that information entered in invoices is correct.
Legal entities can be created automatically for both buyers and suppliers, depending on the information added on 
the invoice:
● Buyer legal entities are created from the Customer address in the Additional Fields section or the Contact 
role="soldTo" tag from the DTD when the country is France.
● Supplier legal entities are created from the Bill From address in the Additional Fields section or the Contact 
role="billFrom" tag from the DTD when the country is France.

Tax invoicing in Italy
Tax invoicing in Italy provides an electronic invoicing solution that includes receiving, validating, transforming, and 
transmitting tax invoices to buying organizations through Ariba Network.
Suppliers in Italy must report all electronic invoices through the governmental electronic invoicing platform 
Sistema di Interscambio (SDI). This is a mandatory regulation initiated by the SDI (Italian Revenue Agency) in Italy, 
and is applicable to all industries.
The SDI is an online system operated and maintained by the Italian tax authorities. Suppliers in Italy must send 
their domestic electronic invoices online to the SDI system in order to get issued.
Furthermore, suppliers must create electronic invoices in the FatturaPA format only. The FatturaPA is an 
electronic invoice in XML format, and is the only type of invoice that is valid and accepted by the Italian tax 
authorities. Suppliers must get their invoices electronically signed, and submit the signed invoices to the SDI 
portal.
Only invoices sent to the SDI portal and approved by the SDI are considered valid invoices. Invoices not reported to 
the SDI system are not accepted. In addition, penalties are levied on defaulting suppliers according to the tax laws 
prevalent in Italy.
Prerequisites
● Buyers and suppliers must register their organiztations at the SDI portal. The VAT ID/Tax ID are the relevant 
identifications for the SDI portal.
● Buying organizations must configure their SDI accounts to get their invoices routed to TrustWeaver and SAP 
Ariba.
● Buyers must upload supplier master data to Ariba Network in order to allow matching from VAT ID/Tax ID to 
the buyer’s vendor IDs.
● Non-Ariba Network suppliers must get their invoices digitally signed by approved service providers, create their 
electronic invoices outside Ariba Network, and send them to the SDI portal for issuance.
Workflow - non-Ariba Network supplier
Invoices in Italy go through the following workflow originating from a non-Ariba Network supplier to a buyer's ERP 
system or SAP Ariba Procurement solution:
1. A non-Ariba Network supplier creates a tax invoice (in FatturaPA XML format ) in a system outside Ariba 
Network.
2. The supplier submits the tax invoice to the SDI portal and receives a positive confirmation after technical 
validation in SDI.
3. The SDI transaction ID is included in the invoice cXML as an extrinsic.
4. Ariba Network creates a PDF of the invoice. The PDF is generated from the FatturaPA XML or from the cXML 
based on the buyer's preference.
5. An SAP Ariba representative uploads the vendor master data CSV file in the buyer's Ariba Network account 
with accurate data in the required fields.

6. Ariba Network sends the following documents to the buyer’s ERP system or SAP Ariba procurement solution:
○ invoice PDF
○ cXML invoice
○ original FatturaPA XML invoice (attached to the cXML invoice)
○ delivery receipt received from SDI (attached to the cXML invoice)
Workflow - Ariba Network supplier
This section describes the workflow starting from the creation of the invoice in Ariba Network to the time when the 
buyer systems receive the invoice.
1. The supplier flips a purchase order to create an invoice, or creates a non-purchase order invoice in Ariba 
Network.
2. Ariba Network performs validation checks for mandatory fields in the invoice.
3. TrustWeaver converts, signs, and sends the signed FatturaPA XML to SDI.
4. SDI receives the supplier invoice and performs its own validation of the mandatory invoice fields.
5. TrustWeaver receives a status update from SDI, and in turn provides the success or rejecton status to Ariba

6. Ariba Network creates a PDF of the invoice. The PDF is generated from the FatturaPA XML or from the cXML 
based on the buyer's preference.
7. An SAP Ariba representative uploads the vendor master data CSV file in the buyer's Ariba Network account 
with accurate data in the required fields.
8. Ariba Network sends the following documents to the buyer’s ERP system or SAP Ariba procurement solution:
○ invoice PDF
○ cXML invoice
○ original FatturaPA XML invoice (attached to the cXML invoice)
SDI transaction LdentLfier
For Ariba Network suppliers For non-Ariba Network suppliers
The SDI transaction ID is included in the invoice cXML as an extrinsic. The extrinsic field used is 
externalTransactionIdentifier.
The SDI delivery receipt is sent (as an attachment to the cXML 
invoice) to the buyer's ERP system or SAP Ariba procurement 
solution. The FatturaPA XML and invoice PDF are also attached to the cXML invoice. As a result, the buyer's account receives all the documents including the metadata file.

Italy specLfic tax invoicing fields
The following fields are specific to tax invoicing in Italy:
Ariba Network online invoice fields
The following is a line level field in the online invoice page on Ariba Network. The field is a pull-down menu item with 
three options. This field also appears on the invoice summary and invoice PDF.
 Note
This field is made visible only when the tax category selected is VAT.
● VAT Due Time Code
○ VAT due immediately: The total tax is added to the subtotal to calculate the amount due. VAT becomes 
due when the invoice is issued.
○ VAT payment deferred: The total tax is added to the subtotal to calculate the amount due. VAT becomes 
due when the invoice is paid.
○ Split payment: The total tax subject to split payment is not added to the amount due. The buyer must pay 
the VAT amount that is subject to split payment directly to the tax authorities in Italy, and not to the 
supplier. In other words, the buyer has to 'split' the total amount due by paying the suppliers for their 
goods/services, and transferring the VAT due directly to the Italian tax authorities.
 Note
When the VAT Due Time Code is Split Payment, the reason for tax exemption cannot be '(N6) Reverse 
Charge'. This is applicable to invoices created online in Ariba Network, and also to invoices created in 
external systems, such as suppliers' ERPs and other in-house systems.
The following is a line level field in the online invoice page on Ariba Network. The field is a pull down menu item with 
two options. This field also appears on the invoice summary and invoice PDF.
● Withholding Tax Type
○ (RT01)Supplier administrator
○ (RT02)Legal personnel
 Note
If multiple line items in an invoice contain withholding tax, the withholding tax type and tax rate must be 
identical in all those line iems.
Multiple tax categories cannot be added in the same line item of an invoice.
External tax invoice handling
An external tax invoice is any tax invoice in electronic format that is not created online in Ariba Network. External 
tax invoice handling allows buyers to apply a specific set of Ariba Network transaction rules to all external tax 
150 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process
invoices irrespective of the supplier that is referenced in the invoice. This set of configurable transaction rules is 
called External Tax Invoice Rules. The configured external tax invoice rules are applied only to external electronic 
tax invoices.
To prevent automatic invoice field validations, buyers typically would like to have less stringent rules for external tax 
invoices than for regular invoices.
● Buyers are given the option to configure a set of invoice rules to be applied to all external tax invoices.
● Buyers can configure transaction rules for external tax invoices by creating supplier groups and configuring
appropriate rules for such groups.
The following table summarizes what Ariba Network does with external tax invoices and regular invoices when a 
buyer account has external tax invoice rules configured.
Invoice Scenario Supplier Is in a Supplier Group Ariba Network Action
Any external tax invoice Does not matter Applies external tax invoice rules
Regular invoice created in Ariba Network Yes Applies group-specific transaction rules
No Applies default transaction rules
Workflow for external tax invoice handling
When a buyer's account in Ariba Network is configured to use external tax invoice rules:
1. Buyer administrators configure external tax invoice rules. These rules are a subset of default transaction rules.
2. Suppliers send an external tax invoice to Ariba Network from their ERP systems or through their service 
provider.
3. Ariba Network receives the external tax invoice invoice and applies external tax invoice rules.
How to confiJure transaction rules for external tax invoices

Tax invoicing in Malaysia
Tax invoicing in Malaysia provides an electronic invoicing solution that includes receiving, validating, transforming, 
and transmitting tax invoices to buying organizations through Ariba Network.
In Malaysia, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was replaced with the Sales and Services Tax (SST) with effect from 
September 01, 2018. Ariba Network has effected changes to its software to enable suppliers and buyers to adhere 
to the new tax regime. Suppliers who create online invoices in Ariba Network and integrated suppliers who create 
invoices in their own accounting systems (or through their service providers) must adopt the new taxation 
guidelines while creating invoices.
A trading organization that engages in business practices in Malaysia must now register for an SST ID. The service 
tax rate in Malaysia is fixed and is 6%. The sales tax rates can be one of 0%, 5%, or 10%.
Tax invoicing in Malaysia supports the following:
● Country-based invoice rules and required fields
● Receiving and sending cXML invoices
● Digital signing process
● Ability to add SST ID for buyers and suppliers
● Ability to add sales and service tax on invoices
Ariba Network supports the following Malaysian invoice types:

The following options are recommended to configure sales tax and service tax in Ariba Network buyer and supplier 
profiles.
● Buyers can configure ‘Sales Tax’ and ‘Service Tax’ entries in the Country-based rules for Malaysia. See How to 
configure country-based invoice rules for Malaysia [page 156] for more information. Suppliers can then choose 
the tax categories configured by buyers from the Category drop-down menu while creating invoices.
● Suppliers can configure taxes while creating invoices by choosing the ɬConfigure Tax Menu’ > ‘Other’ option 
from the Category drop-down menu. For example, if suppliers choose to include service tax at the header or 
line level, they can create a new category called Service Tax using the ɬConfigure Tax Menu’ > ‘Other’ option. 
This newly configured tax category will appear in the Category drop-down options.

Tax invoicing in Singapore
Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a self assessed tax levied on the supply of goods and services in Singapore. GST is 
also charged on imports of goods into Singapore. GST is an indirect tax. It is expressed as a percentage (currently 
7%) on the selling price of goods and services.
The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is the tax authority in Singapore. GST registered business 
entities act as collecting agents on behalf of IRAS.
Suppliers based in Singapore are required to declare their GST ID in their Ariba Network profile if they are 
registered for Goods and Services Tax (GST). Field labels on invoices are different depending on whether or not a 
supplier is registered for GST.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites outlined below are for buyers and suppliers.
● If you are a Singapore-based buyer who trades with Singapore-based suppliers, you must ensure that the 
following rules are disabled in the buyer's Country-based Invoice Rules for Singapore:
○ Require suppliers to provide their tax ID on invoices
○ Require suppliers to provide tax information in invoice headers or line items
○ Require customer's VAT/Tax ID
○ Require supplier's VAT/Tax ID
 Note
If these rules are enabled, suppliers are required to provide their GST registration details before creating 
invoices. This would lead to difficulties for non-GST registered suppliers because they would not be able to 
provide their GST registration information.
● When suppliers create an invoice from a purchase order in Ariba Network, they must select the correct Sold 
From address.
Rules for determining tax invoice and standard invoice
In a broad sense, here are the definitions of standard invoice and tax invoice.
The following are standard invoices:
● Invoices created by non-GST registered suppliers
● Invoices created by GST registered suppliers and if tax is not charged - that is, zero rated, tax exempt, or out of 
scope supplies.
● Invoices created for goods that are shipped out of Singapore.
The following are tax invoices:
● Invoices created by GST registered suppliers
158 C O N F I D E N T I A L
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Countr\specLfic tax invoicing process
● Invoices that contain at least one item that is charged 7% tax
 Note
Tax exempt is not the same as zero taxes.
The following rules are applied to determine the labels that are displayed on invoices - tax invoice or standard 
invoice.
 Note
* Suppliers must select the address where they have a legal profile registered. Rows 4 and 5 below indicate that 
the supplier has not updated their legal profile, but has chosen a location with a Singapore address.

Tax invoicing in countries that require credit memo 
creation when discounts are accepted
Many countries with Value Added Tax (VAT) or similar indirect taxes require suppliers to issue credit memos when a 
buyer and supplier agree to an early payment discount after a tax invoice has been issued.
Buyers can configure Ariba Network to automatically generate credit memos that align to your original tax invoice. 
These dynamic discounting credit memos are generated at the time of payment, upon receipt of the buyer 
remittance. The credit memo copies content from the original tax invoice, adjust taxable amount, prices, and tax 
amount using the discount %, and applies any country-specific e-signatures or business rules. You can use the 
Early Payment (details) report to make tax adjustments, and may archive the automatically generated dynamic 
discounting credit memo cXML and PDF through the Archive Zip process or SAP Ariba's archiving service.
The automatic generation of credit memos functionality is enabled by your buyer and confirmed by you. For more 
information about dynamic discounting credit memos, see Managing discounts.

Timestamp verLficatLon of invoices in Japan
Invoices in Japan must be timestamped and verified by government approved service providers to ensure 
authenticity and integrity of invoices.
Ariba Network interacts with timestamp service providers such as Seiko to timestamp and verify invoices in Japan. 
Suppliers, buyers, or auditors appointed by the National Tax Authority can submit invoices from Ariba Network to 
timestamp and further verify the invoices. In addition, buyers and suppliers enable auditors to verify invoices by 
creating special user profiles for them in Ariba Network.
Cross border and domestic transactions
Transactions in Ariba Network are considered 'cross border' transactions if either the buyer or the supplier is 
outside of a country. If both the buyer and supplier are from within the country, the transactions are considered 
domestic transactions.
According to the eDocument Act in Japan, every invoice that is associated with a cross border transaction or a 
domestic transaction must be timestamped and verified by a service provider.
Invoices in Japan are required to be:
1. Timestamped
2. Made available for verification
Timestamping of invoices
Invoices are automatically sent to Seiko when administrators configure a rule in Ariba Network to enable 
timestamping and verification of invoices. The timestamping vendor, Seiko, attaches a timestamp token to each 
invoice and sends the invoices back to Ariba Network. The timestamp token can be used in future to detect any 
tampering of invoice data.
VerLficatLon of invoices
Seiko sends the timestamped invoices back to Ariba Network. These invoices are now ready to be verified. Buyers, 
suppliers, or auditors can select a group of invoices and send them for verification. Seiko verifies the timestamps 
and sends them back to Ariba Network. Ariba Network displays the verification status in the Timestamp 
Verification tab of invoices.
 Note
● It is not possible to initiate timestamp verification of invoices from other systems. Integrated suppliers also 
must log in to Ariba Network to initiate verification of invoices.
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Timestamp verLficatLon of invoices in Japan C O N F I D E N T I A L 165
● Timestamping and verification of invoices does not apply to Standard and Light Account suppliers.
Validity of invoices
The invoices that are timestamped have a validity of 11 years, 1 month, and 0 days.

Invoice header and line item fields
Invoices are generally comprised of two sections: header-level fields and line-level fields. The available fields
depend on what actions are performed at the header level, and what invoicing rules have been applied. Buyers can 
also specify custom fields to appear on invoices.
Invoice header fields
Invoice header fields apply to the entire invoice:
● Summary
● Tax (unless the buyer requires the supplier to enter it on the line level)
● Shipping (unless the buyer requires the supplier to enter it on the line level)
● Additional Fields
● Order Information (for non-PO invoices only).
The buyer-specified rules control whether the following fields are available for addition:
● Shipping Cost
● Discount
● Special Handling
● Payment Term
● Comment
● Attachment
● Pricing Details
Invoice line item fields
The fields available at the line level depend on the supplier’s header actions and the buyer’s invoicing rule settings. 
By default, a supplier can add discount, special handling charges and comments to invoice detail lines. If a buyer 
requires tax information on line item level, then an additional Tax option is available as a line level action. If a buyer 
Ariba Network guide to invoicing
Standard invoice field reference C O N F I D E N T I A L 169
places a service order (purchase order with at least one line requiring a service sheet), service sheet information is 
available at the line item level as well.
Ariba Network can automatically add digital signatures to invoices for customers in the European Union and in 
some non-European Union countries.
Invoice field descriptions
Buyers can specify custom fields to appear on invoices. Suppliers with questions regarding those fields must 
contact their customers directly.
Buyers can also enable certain invoice rule settings to allow suppliers to add or edit the line items with advanced 
pricing details.
Since the buyer’s invoicing rules determine which fields and actions are available for each of their suppliers, fields
and controls displayed might differ between invoices for different buyers.

Summary fields (header only)
Invoice summary fields contain required invoice header information and aggregated invoice amount information.
Field Description
Invoice # A unique invoice number for this invoice. Typically, the supplier’s order processing 
system generates these numbers. This field is case-sensitive, so INV123 is different
from inv123.
If the buyer accepts duplicate invoice numbers, the supplier can resend invoices with 
the status “Rejected,” “Failed,” or “Canceled” without having to change the invoice 
number. Otherwise, the supplier must change the original invoice number before resending it.
Invoice Date By default, Ariba Network enters the current date, but users can modify it.
Purchase Order The purchase order number from the purchase order.
Remit To Address The address of the entity that will be paid. The address is specified in the 
company name or logo in the upper right corner of the dashboard
Remittances page of the supplier’s account. Each remittance address associated 
with a preferred payment method.
If suppliers have marked a Remit To address as the address of a factoring service, a 
new line, saying Factoring Service will be displayed below the Remit To address. 
When suppliers use a factoring service, the factoring company pays the amount of 
the invoice to the supplier as soon as the invoice is issued. Afterwards, the factoring 
company collects the payment from the buyer by the official invoice due date. 
Thanks to this service, the supplier gets paid earlier than the due date. In exchange, 
the factoring company gets a commission on the invoice amount.
Supplier Tax ID The number used to identify the supplier’s company for tax purposes.
Bill To The name and address of the person being billed. Ariba Network uses values from 
the purchase order.
View/Edit Addresses Click this link to review Remit To and Bill To address details, edit the Bill To address 
fields if allowed by the buyer’s invoicing rules, and edit the following fields:
● Remit To ID: An ID for uniquely identifying the remittance address. It allows the 
buyers to match remittance addresses with the suppliers in their accounting 
system.
● Account Receivable ID: The identification code or number used by the supplier’s accounts receivables department for this invoice.
● Supplier Tax ID: The number used for tax identification purposes.
 Note
If the buyer does not allow editing the Bill To address, the Bill To address 
field appears grayed and noneditable.

The Rate field is required for any selected tax category.
Location The name of the locale in which the tax will be paid.
Description A brief description of the tax. For example, “California sales tax.”
Taxable Amount Sum of all line item amount values.
(VAT Only) If the buyer requires tax amounts in local (the buyers’s) currency, suppliers enter 
the amount and the buyer’s currency (e.g. 150EUR). Ariba Network uses the exchange rate at 
the time of invoice generation to calculate the amount. To change the Tax Exchange Rate, use 
the Additional Fields section.
Rate The tax rate as a numeric value, with decimal point if appropriate. Do not enter a percentage 
symbol (%).
Tax Amount The calculated tax. Buyers can optionally allow suppliers to edit the Tax Amount directly.
Date of Pre-Payment (VAT Only) The date on which pre-payment is made.
Date of Supply (VAT Only) The date on which the service or product was delivered (can be different from the 
invoice date). The default value is the invoice date.
Exempt Detail (VAT Only) Indicates if the tax on services or goods is zero rated or exempt. Zero rated goods 
or services are taxable, but the tax rate is zero. Exempt goods and services are exempt from 
taxation.
Law Reference (VAT Only) Specifies the relevant European Union or national law covering VAT.
Triangular Transaction (VAT Only) Indicates a transaction between organizations in at least three different countries, 
where the invoicing route does not follow the movement of shipped products. See “Additional 
Fields (Header Only)” [page 176].
How Ariba Network calculates total tax
When Ariba Network adds the tax categories to calculate the Total Tax, it rounds Total Tax to the number of decimal 
places according to the currency precision. For example, if Subtotal is $1.235, Total Tax is calculated for $1.24.
Ariba Network uses the following algorithm to calculate Total Tax:
1. For each Tax Category at the invoice line level, it rounds Total Tax to the same number of decimal places as the 
currency’s minor unit precision.
2. It adds all Tax Categories in a particular invoice line and that total becomes the total tax of that line.
3. It adds the tax of all invoice lines and that total becomes the Total Tax of the invoice.

Shipping Date The shipping date
Payment terms fields
Payment terms are a combination of the payment due date and the discount rate or penalty rate.
For example, a supplier can indicate that a balance paid in 15 days will generate a 2% discount, but if the balance is 
paid in 30 days, no discount is given. Similarly, a supplier can indicate that a balance paid after 30 days will 
generate a 2% penalty rate. If a supplier uses either Discount or Penalty Term or Percentage, both are required. If 
the buyer allows suppliers to edit payment terms, the terms are displayed in editable format. By default, suppliers 
cannot edit payment terms. Ariba Network allows suppliers to edit payment terms if purchase orders do not 
specify them.
Field Description
Net Term (days) The number of days in which net payment is due.
Discount or Penalty Term 
(days)
Percentage(%)
The Discount or Penalty Term(days) field is used together with the Percentage(%) field in 
either one of the following ways, depending on the needs of the supplier:
● If suppliers need to add a discount term, they must enter positive values in both the Discount or Penalty Term(days) and Percentage(%) fields.
● If suppliers need to add a penalty term, they must enter negative values in both the Discount or Penalty Term(days) and Percentage(%) fields.

Routing statuses
The Routing Status field describes whether a document made it successfully to its destination system.
For documents you create, such as invoices and service sheets, the routing status informs you whether your 
document reached your customer's system. You can view routing statuses for documents you send in your Outbox.
For documents from your customer, such as orders, releases, time sheets, and remittances, the routing status lets 
you know whether the document reached Ariba Network and any additional systems that you configured to accept 
incoming documents. You can view routing statuses for documents you receive in your Inbox.
Ariba Network shows the following routing statuses:
Status Description
Acknowledged The document reached its destination system. This is the final routing status for documents.
Duplicated This status applies only to remittance advice documents. A remittance advice document has this 
routing status if it's a duplicate of another remittance advice.
Failed Ariba Network could not send the document.
In the case of a purchase order from your customer, Ariba Network couldn't send the order to 
you through email, fax, cXML, or EDI. For example, your order fulfillment system could have experienced a problem that prevented Ariba Network from successfully sending the order. You can resend orders that have a Failed routing status by clicking Resend at the top of the order.
For failed invoices or service sheets, you need to correct any errors and resubmit them to your 
customer.
For any other failed documents, contact your customer to resend them.
Obsoleted After you cancel an invoice or edit and resubmit an invoice or service sheet, the original document moves to Obsoleted status, which indicates that you don't need to take any further action 
on the original document. Once a document has this routing status, you can't make any changes 
to it.
Queued Ariba Network is in the process of sending the document. Contact SAP Ariba Support if a document remains in this status for more than 30 minutes.
Sent Ariba Network sent the document successfully.
For invoices or service sheets, Ariba Network sent the document to your customer, but your customer hasn't yet acknowledged that they received it. If your document stays in this status for an 
extended period of time, contact your customer to see what needs to happen next.
 Note
If your customer allows it, you can cancel an invoice with a routing status of Sent.

Document statuses
A document's status, such as Order Status or Invoice Status, describes where the document stands in its 
processing. If you update part of a document, Ariba Network reports the partial status for the entire document, 
such as Partially Invoiced.
For documents you create, such as invoices and service sheets, the document status lets you know where your 
customer is in the approval process for that document. You can view statuses for documents you send in your 
Outbox.
For documents from your customer, such as orders and releases, the document status tells you where you are with 
regard to processing the document. You can view statuses for documents you receive in your Inbox.
Ariba Network shows the following document statuses:
Status Description
Approved This status applies to invoices, service sheets, and time sheets.
If the document doesn't have any errors, your customer approves it. After a document reaches 
Approved status, you can't make any changes.
 Note
An approved invoice means that your customer has approved it for payment. If you made a 
mistake, you need to send a credit memo to your customer.
Canceled This status applies to invoices, service sheets, and remittance advice documents. After a document reaches Canceled status, you can't make any changes.
In the case of a remittance advice document, your customer canceled the payment transaction. 
When a payment transaction fails, it needs to be canceled to allow for a subsequent attempt to 
complete the payment.
Changed This status applies to orders and releases. Your customer sent a new version to replace the original document.
Confirmed / Partially 
Confirmed
These statuses apply to orders, releases, and time sheets.
For orders and releases, Confirmed means that you agreed to ship all line items, while Partially 
Confirmed means that you agreed to ship some items.
Failed This status applies to orders, releases, and remittance advice documents.
Ariba Network experienced a problem routing the document to your account or any additional 
systems that you configured to accept incoming documents. You can resend orders that have a 
Failed status by clicking Resend at the top of the order.
For remittance advice documents, a Failed status means that the payment transaction failed.
Invalid This status applies only to time sheets. Contact your customer to find out how to handle an invalid time sheet.

payment.
For remittance advice documents:
● Paid status means that the payment transaction was completed successfully.
● Partially Paid status means that payment is still due for the remaining amount shown on 
the remittance advice.
Received / Partially 
Received
These statuses apply to orders and releases.
Your customer creates receipt documents in their system to acknowledge the products they 
physically received. The information from these receipts causes your purchase order status to 
update.
When viewing a purchase order's details in your account, each line item shows the quantity of 
goods received.
Rejected / Partially 
Rejected
These statuses apply to invoices, service sheets, remittance advice documents, and time sheets.

Global e-invoicing requirements [page 200]
Global e-invoicing requirements
Electronic tax invoicing (e-invoicing) is the sending, receipt and storage of invoices in electronic format without the 
use of paper-based invoices as tax originals. For e-invoices to be recognized on an equivalent audit basis as paper 
invoices for value-added tax (VAT) or similar indirect taxes, most countries require e-invoices to meet the 
requirements for content, authenticity, integrity, and archiving. Failure to meet such requirements can lead to 
sanctions, including fines and the possibility of buyers having to repay already deducted VAT.
Implementing a cost-effective tax compliant e-invoicing system requires a holistic approach that takes into account 
technical, process, and legal aspects of a corporation's invoice processes throughout the relevant disciplines in the 
company. However, the approach must be driven by a tax perspective, which means first deciding on the desired 
outcome of an audit process and then designing the system from the resulting requirements.
Trading partner tax responsibilities and liabilities
SAP Ariba does not play a tax advisor role. When a Trading Partner uses a Service Provider, it does not transfer its 
tax responsibilities or liabilities to the Service Provider.
Tax authorities offer system audits to the taxable customer. These audits typically address the “end to end” 
process. SAP Ariba supports reviews of its components by offering process documentation and technical advisory 
services. However, SAP Ariba cannot support non-SAP Ariba components or processes such as tax reports 
generated in the Trading Partners’ AP/ERP systems.
In Europe, local Tax Authorities don't deliver formal certification/authorization letters to providers of e-invoicing 
features like SAP Ariba. For legal and regulatory compliance, each Trading Partner needs to, at its own expense, 
perform the following tasks:
● Obtain all necessary regulatory approvals applicable to its business.
● Obtain any necessary permits for its business and comply in all material respects with all laws and regulatory 
requirements applicable.
SAP Ariba makes no representation as to whether its e-invoicing features satisfy the applicable legal requirements 
regarding tax. Customers should consult with their tax and legal advisor on such issues.

new or changed functionality

SAP Ariba reserves the right to update its technical documentation without prior notification. Most documentation
